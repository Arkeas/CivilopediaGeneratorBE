		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">A player agrees to requests or demands from another player to do or not do certain things. Making the promise produces a small, positive improvement in relations.<br /><br />As with making the promise initially, actually completing the promise has a strong positive impact on relations.<br /><br />If you made a promise to another player but failed to fulfill it, it results in a negative impact on diplomatic relations. Ignoring a request for a promise also has diplomatic penalties, but not as severe as breaking one.</div>
