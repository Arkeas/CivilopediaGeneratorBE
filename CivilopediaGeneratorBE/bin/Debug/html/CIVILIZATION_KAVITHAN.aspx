<h2>Apocalypse</h2><div class="infobox">With end of the Great Mistake and the devastation it had brought, the Indian subcontinent's economic and political position was more precarious than ever. Populations faced extensive coastal flooding, crop failure, and pandemics with limited international humanitarian aid. Millions of refugees poured across India and surrounding nations in the greatest human migration on the subcontinent since the partition in 1947. Clashes between political and religious factions among desperate groups increased, and the centralized political power had only limited ability to help. The specter of a balkanized, ethnically torn subcontinent seemed all too likely.</div>
<h2>Rise of the Prophet</h2><div class="infobox">In this turbulent mix, in the city of Delhi emerged Raj Thakur, a mystic preaching a heterodox and syncretic creed that appealed to all three major religions of the subcontinent. Thakur's message of the great potential of all people, the purifying power of sustainable living, and personal charity did what no political force could - it crossed religious and ethnic boundaries and united the people of the subcontinent. It became a political force of its own, a deeply felt grassroots movement that vanquished the worst of the religious, political, and ethnic violence. Thakur undertook a pilgrimage across the subcontinent on foot, leaving Delhi and walking to the Kush, followed by tens of thousands of his disciples, and a media captivated by the prophet. Arriving in the foothills of the Hindu Kush, Thakur and his followers' tent encampment became a nexus for his teachings, spreading around the world in person and on the Internet and television. His image and words were ubiquitous, bringing solace and care to the poor and diseased, and inspiring many of the upper classes to leave the security of their walled compounds to directly help others.</div>
<h2>Kavitha's Protectorate</h2><div class="infobox">Raj Thakur died just three years after the end of his pilgrimage, leaving the work of his mission to his daughter, Kavitha. Kavitha Thakur is more media-reticent than her father, although this is seen by many as deferential to his vision and her personal choice to focus on her own religious writings. Raj Thakur's teachings and parables often used the imagery of flight and cosmic travel, and Kavitha Thakur has codified these as explicit support for the Seeding. It is said Raj Thakur saw the Inflection Point prophetically, and laid the framework for the Protectorate to participate in the Seeding.</div>
<h2>Great Rejoicing</h2><div class="infobox">Thakurism not only brought an end to warfare on the Indian subcontinent, it also precipitated a cultural flourishing beyond anything that existed up to the Great Mistake. Given a renewed sense of purpose by the Prophet, a great wave of new art, music, cinema, and video gaming sprang up, beginning in Delhi but spreading as fast as Raj Thakur's message of improving the lot of humanity. "The Prophet's Dream" is the common euphemism for the Protectorate's space program, and songs and movies extoll the moral value of educating oneself to work on the Seeding.</div>
<h2>Protecting the Future</h2><div class="infobox">The Protectorate still has decades of war and environmental damage to heal, and resources are scarce, but the people of the Protectorate are optimistic about the future ahead. Of all the nations of the world, the Protectorate probably has the broadest spectrum of support for the Seeding projects, and the Protectorate's methods for choosing Seeding candidates are broadly democratic. Kavitha Thakur, although holding no formal office and claiming no titles for herself, is unquestionably the leader of this political and religious movement, and she has made it clear that she will see her father's dreams realized in this generation.</div>
