		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">While most colonial settlements had a structure that served as a reminder of Old Earth and their journey from it (often centered on some sort of “relic”), in time a number built repositories of information concerning Terra to remind ever younger generations of what had been lost and what had been gained in coming to this alien place. These “Terra vaults” might be considered a technological hybrid of a museum, art gallery, research library, and archive as known on Old Earth. Most of the material in vaults took the form of holograms, data banks, reproductions and later data-jacks for brain-computer interfaces, but there were some original artifacts and hardcopy records. Since these vaults were meant to keep the memory and appreciation of Terra “alive in perpetuity,” they were usually reinforced or underground structures able to withstand most manmade or natural calamities. In some instances, Terra vaults sponsored by settlement administrations focused on the history and culture of the original colonial sponsor, serving the social dynamic of offering a cohesive, coherent interpretation to the citizens. By memorializing the past, it was hoped by some leaders that, as some newer generations drifted ever further from traditional “humanity,” they would be reminded of their human heritage. In time, inevitably, as Old Earth receded from collective memory, many of the Terra vaults drifted into decay or insignificance… but having been built to withstand the ravages of this world, remained standing with their echoes of the past.</div>
