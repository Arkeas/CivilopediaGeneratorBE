		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The first Colonial Soldiers fell under the Air Force-Aerospace Command, rather than the terrestrial Army. Despite popular myth, they were not created as an interstellar military force. Rather, they were conceived as a special-ops unit trained to operate in a variety of high-altitude, off-planet conditions, including weightlessness.<br /><br />It was not until humanity began planning the interstellar colonies that the Soldiers evolved into the force we know today. The unit was redesigned as an all-purpose Assault/Recon team with the singular goal of aiding the colonists as they established outposts on alien worlds.<br /><br />Towards this end, they were trained in the use of pressure suits, capable of withstanding a variety of harsh conditions, including extreme temperatures and radiation. The operation of these suits demanded Soldiers be not only physically fit, but of higher than average intelligence. Those who would join the ranks were required to undergo an intense training program designed to heighten these attributes.<br /><br />The initial exploration of our colonial planets was conducted by the Soldiers, whose tasks included the clearing of alien nests and the mapping of unknown lands. Although many of these units suffered catastrophic casualties, none are known to have perished before completing their mission. If not for the actions of these courageous soldiers, it is doubtful that many of our colonies would have long survived their new world.</div>
