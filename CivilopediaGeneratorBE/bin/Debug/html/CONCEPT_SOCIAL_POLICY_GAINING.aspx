		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Virtues are acquired by the accumulation of Culture. How much Culture is needed depends on how many cities the nation has, and increases exponentially with each Virtue taken. Virtues, and Culture more generally, represent education of citizens and priorities of government. Whereas technologies are “researched” or “discovered,” Virtues evolve. </div>
