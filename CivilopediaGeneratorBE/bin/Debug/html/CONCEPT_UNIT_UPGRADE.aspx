		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Each Unit Type has a Unit Upgrade Tree associated with it. As the player progresses in different Affinities, Upgrades in this tree will unlock. When the player selects one of these Upgrades in the tree, their unit’s Combat Strength is increased, and they pick one of two unique combat benefits. The Unit also changes appearance to reflect the new Upgrade. Upgrades apply instantly to all current and future Units of the same type. A Unit Upgrade's gameplay effects are cumulative, working together with Upgrades previously chosen.</div>
