		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Tacjets are ultra-light aircraft specifically designed for use on alien worlds. Since colonists could not guarantee the atmospheric and gravitational conditions of their planet, the Tacjets were designed to be highly-customizable in order to meet the demands of their environment. Although the flight envelope for these craft tended to be restricted, these “airplanes” were found to perform quite well under most prevailing conditions.<br /><br />Over time, the Tacjets were redesigned in order to make use of the unique energy sources and minerals found on the colonial worlds – most notably, Floatstone. These adaptations allowed for a craft that was both nimble and highly-maneuverable. It also allowed for pilots to modify traditional Earth aerial maneuvers such as the Immelmann, Barrel Roll, and Pitchback, so that they could be used in the planet’s prevailing atmospheric conditions. The more daring pilots even developed new maneuvers, such as the Pelican and Sidereal. It was this mastery of flight that allowed for the Air Fighters to be used against alien species and the occasional colony to great effect.</div>
