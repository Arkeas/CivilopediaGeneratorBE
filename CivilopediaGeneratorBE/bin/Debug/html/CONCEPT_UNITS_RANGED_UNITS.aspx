		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Ranged units are units that can attack enemies in adjacent hexes and in hexes one or more spaces away by bombardment. The distance a unit can attack is determined by its “Range” statistic. The strength of its ranged attack is determined by its “Ranged Combat” statistic.<br />Note that Ranged units always employ Ranged combat when attacking another unit, even if that unit is adjacent. The Ranged unit uses its Combat Strength only when it is defending against an attack by another unit.</div>
