		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The fundamental purpose of an intelligence agency is to gather intelligence without being observed in return. As counter-intelligence programs grow in sophistication (including behavior analysis AI and massively interlinked socioanalyses), the need for better planning and surveillance grows as well. Ops Reconnaissance is designed to maximize the capabilities of Agents to do their fundamental work more efficiently, creating fieldcraft that is indistinguishable from ordinary behavior, maximizing individual awareness, mnemonic and eidetic memory training, and full cultural cloaking.</div>
