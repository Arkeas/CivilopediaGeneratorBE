		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The City Build Menu displays all of the units, buildings and wonders that you can construct in that city at that time. As your technology increases new items will appear. Each entry tells you how many turns it will take until construction is complete. If an entry is greyed-out, then you are currently unable to construct the item. Roll your cursor over the entry to see what you’re missing.</div>
