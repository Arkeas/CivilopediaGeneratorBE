		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">There are four types of non-combat units: Colonists, Workers, Trade Convoys and Trade Vessels. Each is critically important to a colony's success. As the name “non-combat” would suggest, these units cannot fight. If attacked by an enemy unit while alone in a hex, they are automatically captured or destroyed.</div>
