		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">In the past, drones were used for many purposes ranging from private to military applications. Now, drones have been improved to a point where they can autonomously take over the work of humans more efficiently. They are cheap to maintain and are highly productive without the need for a larger population. These properties have proven very desirable on this new world with only a small number of settlers.</div>
