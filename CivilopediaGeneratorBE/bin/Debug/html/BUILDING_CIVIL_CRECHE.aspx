		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">In some settlements, for a variety of reasons ranging from convenience to necessity, the administration established centralized, interlinked food processing and preparation facilities. Patterned on the military “mess,” eating at the cr&egrave;che might be voluntary or mandatory. In those settlements where attendance at the civilian cr&egrave;che is voluntary, the menu offers some variety and benefits, such as additives for health or social purposes. Those where partaking of meals is required of citizens look to foster unity, equality and a sense of community through shared cuisine. The distinctions between the two types can be drawn along the divides between democratic social dynamics and utopian social dynamics. In either, colonial cr&egrave;ches are fully automated, and closely resemble Old Earth cafeteria in terms of being utilitarian and focused on quantity rather than quality. Patterned in part on food banks sponsored by “charitable” organizations recorded by pre-Seeding history, the civil cr&egrave;ches offer nutrition and, in some instances, dormitories and state-sanctioned entertainment venues. As argued by social engineers, what might be lost to the individual in terms of freedom and privacy is counterbalanced by security and comradeship. Whichever view one might hold, none can argue the efficacy of the cr&egrave;ches in promoting colonial growth and health.</div>
