		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Orbital units are powerful but temporary orbiting units, and provide offensive, defensive, and support capabilities to players willing to invest in them. Each orbital unit has a different effect.<br /><br />Orbital units generally don’t interact with one another. They instead support the activities, units, and tiles which exist on the ground layer below them.<br /><br />After a certain amount of time, they de-orbit, and are automatically destroyed.</div>
