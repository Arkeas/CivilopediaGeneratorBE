		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">An Affinity is strongly themed, both fictionally and aesthetically. Each Affinity will also have certain gameplay associations, but an Affinity is not a play style identity. For instance, it is equally valid to play the <span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span> Affinity with a peaceful cultural approach, or with an aggressive expansionist one.</div>
