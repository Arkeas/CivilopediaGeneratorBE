		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Stations have different levels – referred to as “Tiers” – that increase in response to active trade with players. While each station’s level conditions and level cap may be increased, the default behavior is: the station will level up each time a player successfully completes a trade route; higher tiers produce the same reward as lower tiers, but in greater quantity; stations max out at Tier 3.<br /><br />The Station will inform the player what Tier the station is and what conditions must be met for it to advance to the next Tier (or if the station is at its maximum). It will also describe what reward the station will provide at the next Tier.</div>
