		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The following can increase your population’s health:<br /><br />Buildings: Certain Buildings increase your population’s Health. These include the Clinic (able to be constructed from the beginning), the Pharmalab, the Cytonursery, the Gene Garden and others. Each Building constructed anywhere in your colony increases your overall Health (so two Clinics produce twice as much health as one).<br /><br />Wonders: Certain Wonders like the Precog Project and Xenonova can give you a boost in Health.<br /><br />Virtues: Some Virtues provide a boost to Health, notably in the Prosperity path. Note that other Virtues provide bonuses only if the colony is Healthy.<br /><br />Technologies: Technologies themselves don’t provide Health, but they do unlock the buildings and wonders that do.<br /><br />Improvements: Certain improvements, like the Biowell, can boost the Health of your population.</div>
