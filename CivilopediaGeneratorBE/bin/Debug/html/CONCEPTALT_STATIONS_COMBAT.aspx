		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Stations can be attacked in a manner similar to Outposts: they have no ranged strike capabilities and weak Combat Strength, and are destroyed rather than captured when they are overrun.<br /><br />Each Station is treated as an independent entity for purposes of hostility; attacking one will not affect the opinions of any others.</div>
