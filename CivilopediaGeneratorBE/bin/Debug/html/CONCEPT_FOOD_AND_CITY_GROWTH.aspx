		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Plentiful Food is the single most important factor determining the success and survival of any colony, past or future. Once surplus Food is available, city population growth is possible. Left to its own devices, the city will assign as many citizens as needed to acquire its Food. If not enough is available, the city will starve, losing citizens until it can support itself.<br /><br />Each turn, a city’s citizens gather a certain amount of Food from the land around it and from various other sources as described above. The city’s citizens have first call on that Food, and they consume 2 Food for each population point (so a city of population 7 consumes 14 food each turn). Any Food left over is put into the city’s “Growth Bucket.”</div>
