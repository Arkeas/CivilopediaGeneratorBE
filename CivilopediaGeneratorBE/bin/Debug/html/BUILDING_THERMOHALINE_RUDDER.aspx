		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Although not a rudder in the traditional sense, the Thermohaline Rudder still functions as one by creating controlled areas of backwash counter-drag to pull the aquatic-cities known as the ARKs along top-level, oceanic currents. The Thermohaline Rudder is in fact a series of facilities inside of a large complex that monitors and predicts marine-based thermodynamic forces, and allows for the manipulation of these forces so as to effectively “steer” a city. The complex also houses research facilities to monitor and study aquatic life-forms and changes in the environment.<br /><br />Although all ARKs are effectively floating cities, they were not especially designed for mobility but rather habitation. The introduction of the Thermohaline Rudder allowed for cities to avoid aquatic hazards as well as enemy military forces. Alternatively, some cities used this as an advantage in combat, being able to bring an entire city’s defenses to bear down on hostile targets. The Thermohaline Rudder revolutionized marine warfare by introducing the floating city as a mobile fortress. As a result, these complexes became common, and adaptable to multiple biomes, from frigid to primordial.</div>
