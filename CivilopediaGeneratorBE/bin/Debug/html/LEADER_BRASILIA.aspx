<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Said to be the finest soldier ever produced by the Western Hemisphere, Rejinaldo Leonardo Pedro Bolivar de Alencar-Araripe began his celebrated career at the age of 16 by enlisting in Brasilia's Corpo de Fuzileiros Navais, lying about his age in the finest military tradition. His first assignment as a Marine was in support of a Security Council operation in northern Myanmar, where he saved his platoon, called in air support, and coordinated evacuation after their transport was shot down. His ascent after that was meteoric - rising quickly to sargento, then attending the prestigious Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras to become an officer. Commissioned as an Aspiriante at the outbreak of the Peshawar Crisis, he was part of a contingent hastily sent to Asia to help quell the crisis and deliver humanitarian supplies. Again, his heroism was proven at the Battle of Route Blue, as he stepped into command after the first, second, and third commanders of the forces protecting the refugee camp were killed in battle.</div>
<h2>Military Life</h2><div class="infobox">A complete listing of his military accomplishments would exceed the scope of this article, but there were few battlefield commanders held in as broad regard as Bolivar. Resisting staff duty until it became impossible to do so and still serve his nation, Bolivar has been in no less than nine combat tours, seven of them as a commander on the front lines. His talent for planning and improvisation with limited resources are legendary, and when not serving in combat he has been a fixture at Agulhas Negras, training the next generation of military minds.</div>
<h2>Writings</h2><div class="infobox">Somehow, in this illustrious military career, he has found time to write the seminal volume of military sciences in the post-Mistake world: The three-volume Principles of Modern Warfare, and the slimmer On the Training and Conduct of Soldiers (for enlisted soldiers and military cadets). A proponent of special forces, total victory, aerospatial power projection, and professional NCOs, these volumes have served as the blueprint for infantry doctrine around the world, its pithy maxims backed up examples from history and Bolivar's own career. In anyone else, these books would be grandiose; in Bolivar's case they are statement of fact.</div>
<h2>Into Space</h2><div class="infobox">National hero for Brasilia, his name came quickly to the top of the list for commanders of the first Seeding projects. Despite a career "in the mud," Bolivar was endorsed by the Brasilian Air Force and the Space Department. Never one to decline a chance to serve his country, Bolivar honed the first Seeding to leave Earth's orbit into the professional, dedicated, force that was the hallmark of his military career.</div>
