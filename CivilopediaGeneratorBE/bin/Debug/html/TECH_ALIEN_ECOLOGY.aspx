		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">For the first decades after planetfall, the indigenous fauna were viewed by the colonists as inimical, implacable predators. However, a handful of scientists, hoping to avoid the ecological errors of Old Earth, sought to understand the alien lifeforms on their own terms. Using theories from the fields of ethology and comparative psychology, these pioneers focused on adaptive behavior, non-verbal communication, evolutionary psychology – all with the goal of finding ways similar to the relationship humans have with some Earth species, notably those that have been integrated into the human biosphere. Given the behavior and group dynamics of the raptor bugs, the first successes in this effort came with those. Study of the raptors offered insights into similar efforts with the other native wildlife, and most colonies now have research efforts in alien ecology underway.</div>
