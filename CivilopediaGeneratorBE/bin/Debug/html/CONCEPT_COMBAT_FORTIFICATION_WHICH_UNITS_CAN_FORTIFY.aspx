		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Most melee and ranged units can fortify. Non-military, Naval and Air Units cannot fortify. These latter units can “Sleep,” which means that they will remain inactive until attacked or you manually activate them, but they do not receive the defensive bonus.<br />The amount of the bonus depends upon the length of time the unit has been fortified. The unit receives a 25% defensive bonus on the first turn it is fortified and a 50% bonus during all subsequent turns.</div>
