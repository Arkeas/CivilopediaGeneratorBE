<h2>Old Strengths, New Russia</h2><div class="infobox">Although affected by the Great Mistake, Russia's legendarily vast lands and population proved to be valuable resources during the subsequent environmental changes and the long recovery. A strong hand by the central government prevented territories from seceding, and a series of emergency authorizations gave the government the authority to use all resources necessary to preserve the nation. Its military was forced to interpose itself more than once into the violence that rocked Asia and the Russian Federation emerged a much-changed entity. Political leaders saw an opportunity to regain the trust of eastern European nations, especially in light of the dissolution of the EU, and the Federation courted these countries into membership through access to Russia's strategic mineral wealth and a common cultural heritage. Although Slavic in name, the Federation nonetheless contains hundreds of Asian ethnic groups and new populations of refugees. And the Federation seems to suffer little in the way of ethnic or religious strife. The member nations of the Federation enjoy a degree of autonomy, and it must in fairness be said that ethnic minorities are often given freedom to form local governments.</div>
<h2>Mud, Ice, Oil, Metal</h2><div class="infobox">The ecological disasters that followed the Great Mistake meant extensive melting of the permafrost and tundra. If there was an upside to the ecological damage, the warmer temperatures made construction easier, and geological surveying teams found new deposits of strategic minerals and oil in previously inaccessible terrain. Rising sea levels affected the Baltic port cities, but opened up other all-year port possibilities, and the Federation has prospered by selling raw materials and petroleum to the rest of the world. The Trans-Siberian pipelines, highways, and refinery cities are easily visible from orbit, and at night they appear as a glowing spiderweb of headlights and city lights.</div>
<h2>The People's Triumph</h2><div class="infobox">The Federation has earned a reputation as being the world's engineers of heroic infrastructure, and this has given them an edge as they prepare for the Seeding. These huge projects, such as the restoration of the Black Sea and the Volga Dam Network have united the country politically, and given them ample practical experience in construction in difficult situations. Federation engineers are in high demand around the world, and if their projects lack elegance of design, they more than make up for it in robustness.</div>
<h2>Pioneers on New Frontiers</h2><div class="infobox">Of all the post-Mistake nations, the Slavic Federation has emerged as most active in space. The Mir 2 space station, the Zvezdagrad orbital factory, and the Nova Luna installation are rightfully regarded as some of the finest feats of spaceflight up to the Seeding itself. Furthermore, there are multiple overlapping programs in the Federation, mainly military, civilian, private, and academic ones. Roscosmos – now supplied with top academic minds from all the Federation members – took a leading role in scientific advancement and the development of spacefaring technology.</div>
<h2>To Space</h2><div class="infobox">Up until the Seeding, the Federation took a matter-of-fact attitude towards its terrestrial engineering and space program. They were seen as tools that were needed to improve the lives of its citizens, but increasingly the Federation has cast its work as being for the continuity of humanity. Federation technology can overcome any challenge, and federation know-how can find a solution to any problem. That philosophy motivated its herculean efforts in the colonization movement over the years leading to the Inflection Point.</div>
