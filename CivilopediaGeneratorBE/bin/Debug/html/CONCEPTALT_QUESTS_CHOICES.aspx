		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Quests may involve the player making a choice. Choices can branch the quest narrative or provide alternate rewards. When a player is presented with a choice, it must be resolved before the turn is complete. In the case of a multiplayer game where the player fails to make the choice before the turn timer expires, the player is presented with the choice on the next turn.</div>
