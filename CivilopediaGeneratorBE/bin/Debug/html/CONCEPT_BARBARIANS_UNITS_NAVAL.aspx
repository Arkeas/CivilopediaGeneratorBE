		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Alien units encountered at sea are melee units that use their size to bludgeon your naval vessels until they sink.<br /><br />They generally will not attack humans unless a human has been killing them in large numbers (at land or sea). If this occurs, the aliens will become very aggressive, and if enough are involved, they can take down a poorly-defended city.</div>
