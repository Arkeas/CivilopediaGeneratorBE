		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In general, units move from hex to hex, paying the “Movement Cost” required to enter that new hex. Units are subject to “Stacking” limitations – two military units may not end their turn in the same hex, nor can two non-military units, but one military and one non-military unit may end their turn in the same hex. Most units are limited in where they can move – land units cannot enter mountain hexes and naval units cannot enter land hexes (except for port cities).</div>
