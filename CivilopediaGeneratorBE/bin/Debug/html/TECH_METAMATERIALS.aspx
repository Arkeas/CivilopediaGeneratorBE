		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">As the Seeding began, the development of metamaterials – man-made materials with a repetitive structure on a scale smaller than various types of wavelength – with negative indices of refraction became crucial for the design of interstellar spacecraft. The particulars of their construction (size, shape, configuration, and so forth) can amplify or alter light and sound waves in ways unachievable with conventional composites. On the macro scale, colonial scientists working with metamaterials devised orbital and ground-based “super-lenses,” audio sensors and radomes. On the micro-scale, bio-mechatronic organs allowing for specialized audio and visual human implants were developed by teams of physicians and engineers. The full extent of uses for the metamaterials created on this planet has yet to be reached.</div>
