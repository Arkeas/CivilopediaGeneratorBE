		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Some ranged units are capable of “indirect fire,” which means that they can shoot at targets they can’t see, as long as another friendly unit can see them. For example, a Siege unit can shoot over a hill at a target it can’t see if a friendly unit is atop that hill.</div>
