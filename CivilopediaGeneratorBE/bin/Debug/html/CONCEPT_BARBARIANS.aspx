		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Aliens are the indigenous life forms on this new world. They exist in a variety of types and can be found on every type of terrain, often in great abundance around their nest sites. As you establish yourself on the planet, you must decide how you will interact with these creatures.<br /><br />Aliens can be a threat. They will defend their nests if they feel your units are encroaching too close, and they will aggressively attack your units and cities if you antagonize them. However, they are not necessarily your enemies, and can be kept neutral or even friendly if you are willing to work around them.<br /><br /></div>
