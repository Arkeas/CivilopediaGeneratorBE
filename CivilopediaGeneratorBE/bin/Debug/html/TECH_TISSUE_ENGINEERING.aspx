		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Using a variety of methods – nanofiber self-assembly, emulsification, electrospinning, bioreactors, and others – scientists on Old Earth were able to create biological replacements for several types of human tissue: cartilage, arteries and veins, skin, muscle, bone marrow, and so forth. Colonial medical researchers have continued investigation into the possibilities of tissue engineering, initially to treat the injuries and alien illnesses suffered by colonists during settlement and more recently in efforts to adapt humans and Earth animals to native conditions. Perhaps the most exciting development has been the invention of printable organs. Using modified 3D printers with a suspension of “smart” gel and living stem cells, alternating patterns of gel and cells are created; the cells fuse together to form tissue as the gel is removed, leaving custom organs.</div>
