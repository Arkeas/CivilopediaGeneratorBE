		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In Civilization: Beyond Earth, the alien world is made up of hexagonally-shaped “tiles.” These tiles come in a variety of “terrain types”: desert, plains, grassland, hills and so forth – and many include “features” like forests or marshes. These help determine the tile’s usefulness to a nearby city as well as how easy or difficult it is to move through the tile. A tile’s terrain and features may have important effects upon any combat occurring there.</div>
