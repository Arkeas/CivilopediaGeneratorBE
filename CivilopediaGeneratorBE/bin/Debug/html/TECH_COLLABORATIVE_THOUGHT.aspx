		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Derived in part from the systems theories of von Bertalanffy and Ashby, in part from the sociocracy systems of the late 20th Century, in part from the “Delphi” method of problem solving pioneered by the RAND Corporation on Old Earth, “collaborative thought” makes use of brain-computer informatics interfaces to foster artistic and rationalist creativity. Initially conceptualized by early colonial philosophers, collaborative thought was seized upon by colonial administrators as a working method to resolving the many challenges facing their settlements. By bringing together leading scientists, artists, military officers, businessmen and others, it was believed that imaginative solutions could be offered, evaluated and implemented much quicker than before. A collateral benefit, according to some, was the fostering of groupthink among their citizenry.</div>
