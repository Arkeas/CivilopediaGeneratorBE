		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Based on the hypothetical assumption that a planet’s global ecosystem can be evaluated as a single organism, colonial researchers have focused on the biosphere as the study of the interactions of separate ecosystems within that superorganism. The founder of biogeochemistry on Old Earth, Vladimir Vernadsky (1863-1945 AD), suggested that the geosphere and biosphere are closely related, both shaped by the other in a symbiotic relationship, a notion popular among some colonists on this planet. This concept led colonial scientists to theorize that a series of natural, co-feedback loops self-regulate the global biosphere through climate and natural disasters; if the case, understanding the mechanisms might prove beneficial in finding means to avoid some of the extremes of weather, volcanism and seismic activity that have afflicted the colonies, as well as co-exist in harmony with the planetary flora and fauna.</div>
