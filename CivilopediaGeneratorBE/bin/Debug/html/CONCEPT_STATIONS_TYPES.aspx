		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Although each station is unique, most fall into one of two types: quest or yield.<br /><br />Quest stations are unique, and their interactions are tailored to their specific role. In most cases, a quest station's interaction is simple a sequence of activities that, if completed, produces a reward from the station for the player.<br /><br />Yield stations, as the name suggests, provide one or more bonuses to the city that establishes a trade route with them. Higher levels of stations provide greater yields or more varieties of yields.</div>
