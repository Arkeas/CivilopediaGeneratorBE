		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The theories of Old Earth evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond, concerning criteria for animal domestication, enjoyed a revival among colonial animal behaviorists when the debate on putting some of the indigenous species to active use. According to Diamond, among the six criteria for a species to be subject to human domestication are such things as a flexible diet, reasonable growth rate, passive temperament (with a flocking instinct a bonus), and a modifiable social hierarchy; as the wilderness was tamed, colonial ethologists began a search for these criteria among the planet’s fauna. One of their first successes came with the raptor bugs, which had long been known to respond to operant conditioning; once methods to modify their inherited temperament, humans found that the raptors proved a benefit in societies seeking a systemic adaptation to life on this world.</div>
