		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Multipurpose combat systems were long shunned by military strategists because "a tool that does everything doesn't do anything well." But Supremacy military scientists recognized that bringing the right weapon into position was often not feasible on a rapidly-evolving battlefield, and that there was a strong need for a weapons platform which combined weapon flexibility and high maneuverability. This need was met with the ANGEL.<br /><br />This heavy assault and battlefield support platform bristles with a variety of weapons, has the highest mobility of all known apex military units, and fulfills a huge number of tactical roles. Each of its articulating legs are controlled by an AI system devoted to moving most easily through the terrain, such that crews describe ANGEL as feeling as though it floats over the terrain. Its primary sensor nets also integrate information from related units, thus giving it over-the-horizon awareness of its tactical situation. This allows ANGEL to engage and complete tactical withdrawals before local forces can counter-engage. ANGEL brings the best weapon for the best situation, and disengages at a time of its choosing to strike again at another location. It truly best embodies the best ideas of land warfare in the Supremacy idiom.<br /><br />On paper, the ANGEL looks to be the weakest of the major Affinity battle systems, but in application it is a far harder weapon to beat. Supremacy weapons are not simply judged on the raw stats of their guns and the thickness of their armor, but on the coordination and flexibility that defines their use. For centuries, prevailing military wisdom held that specialization was the pathway to success. The ANGEL seeks to overturn that.</div>
