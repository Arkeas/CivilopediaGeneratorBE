		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Once colonial botanists began engineering indigenous flora for utilitarian purposes – agricultural, pharmaceutical, military toxins, and such – special nurseries were built to propagate these species. The xenonurseries were as varied in approach as those on Old Earth: in enclosed fields, in containers and beds, in greenhouses, in aquaculture ponds. While the mass production of seedlings and sets is labor intensive, much of this work has been relegated to automation and robots for temperature control, ventilation, light control, watering and feeding. While native and engineered species are occasionally propagated by seeds or spores, most cultivars are propagated asexually via cuttings or cloning. Those plants which have bulbs are reproduced via twin-scaling; recently, an increasing number of colonial xenonurseries use micropropagation for mass reproduction of a progenitor plant. Once the young plants are well established, they are usually transplanted to open-atmosphere fields or orchards for commercial purposes. Recently, some xenonurseries have been dedicated to propagation of unaltered native species in an effort to conserve those threatened by colonial expansion and terraforming. Like the alien preserves, these dedicated xenonurseries are the site of research in various disciplines, as well as used for cultural, recreational and educational purposes.</div>
