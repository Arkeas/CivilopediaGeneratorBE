		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">In the century prior to the Great Mistake, the progressive empire of the United States of America created the “Space Surveillance Network” to detect, identify, catalogue and track all artificial objects orbiting Old Earth; using very-high frequency radar, ground-based interferometers, electro-optical satellite camera platforms and other devices, the system sought to create a database for military/security and for operational launch purposes. Likewise, and for similar reasons, as ever more colonies placed satellites in the orbital layer around this planet many governors were advised to establish similar networks. Using the latest advances in radar, lidar, various types of optical telescopes (both ground and mag-lev), detectors operating outside the optical spectrum and other types of long-range sensors, continuously updated data is gathered on every orbital object. Using quantum computers, the system produces a catalogue. Different astrodynamic theories are used to update and maintain these catalogues; each however utilizes differential and transcendental math derivatives to calculate zonal harmonics, third-body influences and resonance effects to produce a projection of current and future positions. Using holographic projectors, a static or virtual spherical image of the orbital layer can be created – a Neoplanetarium. As a monitoring system, Neoplanetariums have become crucial for designing and launching new satellites most efficiently, and for optimizing the orbits of existing ones … as well, of course, of monitoring the orbitals of other colonies.</div>
