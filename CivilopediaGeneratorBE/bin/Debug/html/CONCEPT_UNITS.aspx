		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In Civilization: Beyond Earth, the term “unit” refers to anything that can move around the map. There are a number of different types of units that could be in play – military units, Workers, Colonists, Trade Convoys, Orbital units and the like.<br /><br />There are three basic types of units: combat units, non-combat units, and orbital units. The type of a unit determines that unit's gameplay attributes: Required Technology, Combat Power, Ranged Combat Power, Movement, and so forth. It also determines the basic aesthetics of that unit: whether it consists of personnel or vehicles, what kinds of weapons it uses, and such.</div>
