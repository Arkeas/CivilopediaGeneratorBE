		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">There are a couple of diplomatic states that can be entered into in conjunction with certain other states, but are not required as a prerequisite for any diplomatic state.<br /><br />Open Borders:<br />This allows open travel across the other player’s territory. This agreement may accompany the diplomatic states of Neutral, Cooperation Agreement or Alliance (automatically included).<br /><br />Condemnation: One of the other colonial leaders is irritated with you, and makes a public announcement condemning your action(s). Condemnations can often be a prelude to war, but different condemnations will drive different leader personalities to war at different rates. Players can condemn multiple activities by another player simultaneously. Condemnation may accompany the states of Peace, Neutral, Cooperation Agreement or Alliance.</div>
