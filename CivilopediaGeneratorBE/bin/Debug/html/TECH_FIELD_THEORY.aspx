		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Prior to the Seeding, several Old Earth research institutions were exploring the old science-fantasy concept of man-made “force fields,” and there had been some promising work in the creation of charged plasma fields and of mini-magnetospheres (temporary magnetic fields). Despite some progress, energy field theory had not advanced enough to be of aid immediately after planetfall, and the settlements had to rely on traditional defenses. However, a few physicists continued the research effort, but found these approaches limited. Instead, they turned to the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics for a new approach; the theory reconciles quantum mechanics and special relativity, describing all phenomena in terms of the anomalous magnetic moment of electrons. In time colonial physicists were able to devise several prototypes that could create a thin “quantum vacuum” that serves as a barrier to both particles and waves, and hence halt penetration by both matter and energy.</div>
