		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Civil engineering focuses on the design, construction and maintenance of the structures and systems that provide support for the civilian population – the roads, bridges, dams, utilities and the like that are vital to a modern civilization. Arrival on this planet launched a furious effort to adapt Old Earth civil support systems to the alien environment, and led to significant advances in sub-disciplines such as geotechnical, environmental and control engineering. Of special importance was research into transportation engineering, as colonial administrators were faced with challenges in moving people and materials about; later, as a result of population growth, urban civil support became a priority. In its many forms, civil support research continues apace as humanity spreads across this new world.</div>
