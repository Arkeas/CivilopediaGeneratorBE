		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">While at War, you can offer to establish peace through the Diplomacy Overview. The terms of a peace treaty are automatically chosen and based on the progress of the war, represented by the two sides' War Scores. These terms could represent a White Peace, a treaty where no sides gain or lose anything, or they could represent spoils for the victor such as the surrender of Cities. Even if you consider the terms acceptable and offer peace, your opponent may not and could refuse the peace offer, in which case the war will continue.<br /><br /></div>
