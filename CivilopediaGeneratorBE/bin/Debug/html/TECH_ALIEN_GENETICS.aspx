		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The genetic codes of most of the flora and fauna of Old Earth had been mapped by the time of the interstellar diaspora. Shortly after arrival on this planet, geneticists set to the task of doing the same for the indigenous lifeforms here. From the time of Mendel to Lamarck to Khorana, understanding the basic structures has progressed at an increasing pace. Although the alternate DNA structures – primarily A-DNA – and cylindrical harmonic genetic structure of many of the native species slowed the effort, the genetic codes have been unlocked by colonial scientists. Research in alien genetics continues, with an emphasis on practical applications. In those colonies striving to modify the local wildlife to suit their own purposes, this push has led to developments in genetic engineering and manipulation, including new “designer” alien species.</div>
