		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">As developed on this world, vertical farming took the form of rounded skyscraper greenhouses, where sunlight could be augmented with artificial lighting to promote photosynthesis in crops. Built upon microbiologist Dickson Despommier’s 2010 AD designs, the domes use water and nutrient recycling systems powered by externally mounted solar panels and wind turbines to accelerate growth in soilless cultivation. The advantages to vertical farming in the mode practiced by the colonies are numerous: protection from the vagaries of this planet’s weather and climate, conservation of scarce mineral resources, increased yield, less need for herbicides, fungicides and pesticides, as well as other benefits. A number of colonial settlements have come to depend on their domes for all manner of food and pharmacological plants, and would be much smaller without these.</div>
