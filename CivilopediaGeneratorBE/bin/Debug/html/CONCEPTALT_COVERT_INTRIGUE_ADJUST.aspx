		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Intrigue is accumulated in a city as agents successfully complete operations there. The higher the intrigue in a city, the more advanced the operations are that can be performed there. If you place an Agent in one of your own cities, the intrigue in that city will decrease over time.  Buildings, virtues, and satellites can also affect intrigue.</div>
