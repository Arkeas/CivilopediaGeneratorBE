		<h2>Game Info:</h2><div class="infobox">Although only the largest organizations, nations, and corporations could afford the resources, personnel and expertise to outfit a full colony mission during the Seeding, many lesser entities managed to launch small endeavors to establish stations devoted to specific tasks.<br /><br />Having made planetfall, these groups would pursue their goals with near fanaticism, often existing at the tolerance of the major colonies growing around them. The stations managed to survive for decades through trading with the colonists, offering expertise or materials that the colony desired or needed.<br /><br />Frequently competition for the station’s trade between competing colonies could be fierce, even violent. When colonial expansion or lack of trading opportunities brought hardship to the station masters, they were not averse to moving on. Indeed, initial landings on many unexplored planets during the Seeding were first made by the adventurous and rambunctious station masters seeking wealth, knowledge or simply fame.</div>
