		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Expeditions are multi-turn projects, deployed on an expedition site tile, that consume an Expedition Module but produce a special result upon completion. The player moves the Explorer unit to an expedition site on the map. Once in place, the player activates the Expedition action for the Explorer unit.<br /><br />The Explorer begins “working” its plot. When the Expedition is complete, the player receives a gameplay bonus based on the type of Expedition site.</div>
