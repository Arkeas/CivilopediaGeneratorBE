		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Although the entire biosphere, from the microscopic upward, was “alien,” it was the larger native lifeforms that drew the most attention – for obvious reasons. Initially, understanding was limited to autopsies of dead specimens and field observations of the likes of wolf beetles, raptor bugs, siege worms, kraken, etc. Eventually, living specimens were captured and confined in wildlife preserves, where crypto- and xeno-zoologists could focus on ethology, systematics and behavioral ecology rather than simply anatomy and physiology. In some colonies, these preserves were used for the edification of the population as well, being opened at select times to civilians, which had the benefit of raising general understanding of the alien lifeforms with which they shared their new home.</div>
