		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Branch techs form the backbone of the web. They are heavily themed around the technology threads and guide the player through the web to find those advantages that they are most interested in acquiring. Intentionally conceptual and general, branch techs do not themselves provide many advantages to the player, but instead lead to leaf techs that carry most of the catalog of new units, buildings, wonders and such in the web.</div>
