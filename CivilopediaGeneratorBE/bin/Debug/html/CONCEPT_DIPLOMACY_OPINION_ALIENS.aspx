		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The two players share the same demonstrated attitude towards the aliens. This can be either anti-alien or pro-alien, so long as both operate in a similar manner.<br /><br />If the player takes a hostile, extermination-based approach to the aliens, targeting their units with military force and clearing their nests, it is considered anti-alien. This also includes clearing miasma in unclaimed land.<br /><br />If the player avoids combat with the aliens, employs passive defenses like building Ultrasonic Fence buildings, and/or is actively engaged in spreading miasma, he is considered to be pro-alien. (These are all universally associated with a Harmony build, incidentally.)<br /><br />The two colonies are demonstrating opposing approaches to the aliens, one being anti-alien and the other being pro-alien. This has a negative impact on relations between the two. This activity can provoke a condemnation.</div>
