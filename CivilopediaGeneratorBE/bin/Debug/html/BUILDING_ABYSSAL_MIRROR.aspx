But the little fishes fed on his body and turned into sea dragons, and the squid drank his blood and turned into krakens, and Anansi stole one of Paul’s eyeballs to look at the stars."<br />- The Uncle Nevercloned Stories</div>
		
		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Many of the most ancient Earth magnifiers used curved lenses that emulated a simple drop of water. Not until the advent of associated technologies, could the concept of turning the ocean itself into a magnifier be imaginable. The Abyssal Mirror is a colossal seabed-earthwork in the shape of a hemispherical lens; the drop of water. It is used to receive and relay communication between orbital signals and due to its unique design the number of signals it can manage is limitless.<br /> <br />Implanted with ultra-sensitive receptors and utilizing a network of condenser drones, the Mirror is capable of altering the density and movement of the surrounding water. The extreme precision with which it manipulates the surrounding ocean, from the base of the Mirror to the surface, allows the surrounding ocean to function as a gigantic lens. Further manipulation will adjust the lens along with the remote alignment and coordination of orbital objects, producing the Mirror's limitless signal processing.<br /> <br />The name "Abyssal Mirror", while fitting in its description, actually derives its name from a one-time test, when the lens was focused into empty space. For miles, the ever turbulent undulation of the sea became glass still for several minutes as the lens' magnification was tuned to reach out into the infinite dark above, searching for signals. Filtering out the noise of starships, distant satellites orbiting their own planets, a steady signal persisted. A steady, resonant pitch, similar to a flute. The nature of the signal is still unknown. Technicians claim the "monotonous piping" may be the result of a failing receiving system. Fanciful speculation led others to compose wild theories.</div>
