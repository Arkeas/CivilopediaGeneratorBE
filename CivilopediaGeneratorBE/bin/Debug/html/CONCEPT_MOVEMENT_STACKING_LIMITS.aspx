		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Only one combat unit can end its turn in a tile, and only one non-combat unit can end its move in a tile – though a single combat unit and a single non-combat unit can end their turn “stacked” in the same tile. A unit may pass through another unit as long as it has enough movement to complete the full move, and does not end in the same hex as another unit of the same type. The exception to this rule are Air Units, which can have up to three occupying a single tile.</div>
