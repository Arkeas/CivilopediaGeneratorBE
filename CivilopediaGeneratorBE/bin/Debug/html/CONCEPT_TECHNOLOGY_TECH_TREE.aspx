		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Technology in this game represents progressing not along a trajectory from primitive to advanced, but outward into an uncertain future – a future where knowledge may be advanced, but in different ways. Players will face a greater variety of choice in their momentary and long-term technology decisions, and be empowered to change direction quickly and fluidly as they react to the changing circumstances in their game.<br />The structure of the tech web in Beyond Earth is organized around a combination of “major” and “minor” techs that are organized in a specific structure that interconnects and diversifies the choices and decisions a player will encounter. These different types of techs are called branches and leaves, and the overall paradigm is referred to as the "leaf pattern".<br />The leaf pattern changes the progression of technology from a linear, prerequisite-based traversal to an exploration of themes in general-to-specific direction. Players research the branches that express their interests or play style, then research the leaves that give them the specific items they want or need.</div>
