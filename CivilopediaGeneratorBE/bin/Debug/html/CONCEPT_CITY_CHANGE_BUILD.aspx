		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">If you wish to change what a city is constructing, you may do so on the City Screen. The production already expended on the original item is not applied to the new item; however, it remains “on the books” for a while and if you later order that city to resume construction on the original item, it may get the benefit of some or all of the earlier production. The longer the delay, the more production is lost.</div>
