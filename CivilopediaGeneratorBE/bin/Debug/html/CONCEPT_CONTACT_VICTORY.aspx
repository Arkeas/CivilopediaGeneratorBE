		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">This is a universal victory in which the player makes contact with a benevolent, advanced alien race and fundamentally alters the meaning of human existence through this. This victory is geared toward the economy-focused player, and can be accomplished with any Affinity.<br /><br />There are four steps to a Contact Victory: discovering The Signal, decoding The Signal, building the Beacon, and activating the Beacon.<br /><br />To discover the Signal, the player has to complete 2 of the following actions:<br />- Complete the Transcendental Equation City Project.<br />- Launch a Deep Space Telescope orbital unit to reveal The Signal within a random number of turns.<br />- Investigate a Progenitor Ruins site with an Explorer on the map.<br /><br />Decoding The Signal is accomplished by completing the Decode Signal City Project.<br /><br />The Beacon is a Planetary Wonder. After The Signal is decoded, the Beacon Project will be unlocked and is buildable in any City. After the Beacon is built, the player may activate it by committing 1000 Energy. While the Beacon is running, it completely consumes the player’s global Energy surplus. The player can deactivate the Beacon at any time without loss of progress towards victory.<br /><br />The Beacon requires a set amount of Energy to complete the victory. Each turn, it contributes the player's Energy surplus to this total. When the total is reached, the victory is achieved.</div>
