		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">All watercraft, from the ancient raft to contemporary hydrophobic a-levbarques, are constructed outside of their aquatic environment. Access of personnel and heavy machinery to the most delicate and sensitive portions of an aquatic vessel requires dry-land assembly, or the ability to remove the vessel from the water in some form. The Drydock complex facilitates and expedites the latter by utilizing mag-lev engines in tandem with automated machinery to construct vessels in a marine environment. A mobile factory platform comprised of aerial and subaquatic drones, the Drydock is capable of simulating a dry-land environment in any situation. Larger craft—such as cargo vessels and carriers—are constructed above-water and lowered into regular dock, whereas smaller naval vessels like submarines or gunboats are constructed by displacing the area around the construction site. This allows for subaquatic construction while minimizing production time. Some colonial engineers have integrated the use of Floatstone hydraulics to aid in suspension and build time for component assembly.  As far as construction, the Drydock completely replaces the graving and floating docks of Old Earth in favor of an adaptable, multi-purpose facility.</div>
