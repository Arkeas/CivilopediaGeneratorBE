		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">What does it mean to be human? Clearly it cannot be to pursue the identity of the unique self, which must be achieved at the expense of other equally valid humans. Nor can it merely be the propagation of memetic systems, ideologies, religious beliefs, philosophical positions, or moral axioms. No, the truest expression of the meaning of humanity is found in the complete sublimation of the self, leaving behind the quintessence of humanity - the collective will and action of many individuals, each of whom is defined only in the ideal of the whole.<br /><br />As the human in its unenlightened condition seeks to operate in terms of the individualized self, removing the obstacles to the collective whole requires a holistic approach, and thus the Human Hive is conceived. It begins with a structure designed for total self-less realization, its architecture self-sustaining while permitting no internal isolation. Within this building it houses individuals who seek the reification of the collective human purpose, practicing systems of ego-abnegation which transcend the usual pejorative "groupthink drill." And then this system must practice sustaining itself, optimizing the collective behavior until the Hive responds as a whole.<br /><br />The Human Hive demonstrated how eusociality could overcome the crude evolutionary history of mankind and make humanity function without the impairing inefficiencies of selfishness and egoism. Only the Hive could have conceived of the WorkMax Protocols for labor relations. Only the Hive could have conceived of and demonstrated how Wantlessness Theory applied to populations at large. No AI or counter-intelligence network could guard secrets as well as the Hive, for whom impenetrability was a welcome byproduct of the seamless functioning of the whole. And who but the Hive could have introduced I/We/Thou/They Dissolution to the memetosystem?<br /><br />What does it mean to be human? The Hive tells us the answer: One mind; many bodies. One will; many hands. One purpose; one humanity.</div>
