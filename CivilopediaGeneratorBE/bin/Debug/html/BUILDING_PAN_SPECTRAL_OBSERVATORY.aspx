		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">An observatory is a structure that allows a glimpse into the vastness of space from the surface of a planet. In the past, these were used to see the closest stars and planets, and to discover new celestial bodies. Pan-Spectral observatories, though, are used for another, very important, objective. They are able to not only track but also predict solar winds. These winds can be detrimental to satellites. By predicting their precise timing and strength, Pan-Spectral observatories help save satellites from being destroyed by solar winds.</div>
