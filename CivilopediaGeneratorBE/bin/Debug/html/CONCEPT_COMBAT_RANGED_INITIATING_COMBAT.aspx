		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Any unit that can engage in ranged combat has a Ranged Combat Strength value. This number is compared with the target’s Combat Strength to determine the results of the attack. With the ranged unit active, right-click on the target, and a red arrow will appear. Confirm the attack by clicking on the target again.<br />To see the potential effects of a ranged attack, with the attacking unit active hover the cursor over the potential target. The “Combat Information Table” will appear, showing you the losses (if any) the target will take from a ranged attack by your active unit.</div>
