		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Martial Law occurs immediately after conquest, regardless of whether the player chooses to Puppet or Annex the city. While in Martial Law, the city has drastically reduced or wholly ineffectual yield output, cannot build or buy tiles, and cannot use ranged strikes. Martial Law remains in effect for a set number of turns – the exact number is based on a minimum value plus the city’s population.</div>
