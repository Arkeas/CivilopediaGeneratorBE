		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">After the Beacon is built, the player may activate it. The player's net Energy income must be positive to activate the Beacon. This means they must be producing a surplus of Energy above what they need to pay maintenance.<br /><br />While the Beacon is running, it completely consumes the player's global Energy surplus. The Beacon requires a set amount of Energy to complete the victory. Each turn, it contributes the player's Energy surplus to this total. When the total is reached, the Contact Victory is achieved.<br /><br />The player can deactivate the Beacon at any time without loss of progress towards victory.</div>
