		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">When colonial scientists were finally able to create quantum vacuums of variable size, both absorption and concentration force fields could be generated. The former was a functional force field utilizing a quantum vacuum to absorb wavelengths, frequencies and energies in the electromagnetic spectrum. The absorption coefficient of the field depended on the attenuation coefficient and molar absorptivity of the quantum vacuum was a factor of the amount of quantum energy used to generate the field, and could dissipate virtually all outside energy forms. “Concentration” fields, once it was discovered that a quantum vacuum could drain kinetic energy and momentum from particles, were devised to deflect or stop solid objects. Based on the Schrodinger equations for step potential, the strength of the quantum vacuum determined its effect on solid matter. In time, laboratories for esoteric physics and chemistry research utilizing these fields were built. In a Magnetic-Anomaly Neutral Technology Laboratory (MANTL), penetration of a confined region by both particles and waves could be limited or suspended entirely. The fields can be used to artificially create every environment (including interstellar vacuums or plasma cores) and work space (such as bio-exclusive alloy smelters or wet hypercores) for research in all scientific disciplines. To produce “weightless” conditions refined floatstone was incorporated into absorption fields, allowing research previously possible only in orbital labs. Work in the colonial MANTLs has produced most of the postmodern advances in science on this planet, both theoretical and practical.</div>
