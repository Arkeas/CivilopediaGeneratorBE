		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Colonies have the ability to publicly "Condemn" other colonies who have slighted them. However, there are diplomatic repercussions to consider and condemnation shouldn't be taken lightly. A colony you Condemn will be wary of any later attempts at diplomacy, and it will take years before they forget your actions. On the other hand, a carefully timed condemnation as a prelude to war could benefit you by drawing the other enemies of your target out of the woodwork and into the war as your allies.</div>
