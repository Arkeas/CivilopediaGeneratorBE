		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Intelligence agencies undertake direct action (such as limited combat, infiltration, or assassination) only rarely, as these activities are risky and expensive. Losing a highly-trained direct action cell represents not only the loss of expensively-trained and equipped operatives, but carries opportunity costs as well. For this reason, many agencies choose to back their direct action teams with robust ops support, including realtime secure dark networks, black ice AI, and elite extraction logistics teams. An agency with robust ops support can take down an enemy target, anywhere they choose, with the maximum chance of success.</div>
