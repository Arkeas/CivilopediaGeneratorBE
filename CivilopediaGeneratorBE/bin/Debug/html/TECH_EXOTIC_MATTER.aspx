		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Exotic matter, long theoretical on Old Earth, has been generated in limited quantities by colonial scientists through a variety of methods. Exotic matter encompasses particles with physical properties that violate known laws of physics (such as having negative mass), chemical elements outside the periodic table, dark matter, and quantum states of matter (such as Bose-Einstein condensates and pentaquark baryons). All have the potential to serve as the basis for practical applications, although these are as yet only theorized. Using femtotechnology for exotic matter, it may be possible to create self-replicating molecular machines composed of nucleons rather than atoms. One possible application of such, since there are a finite number of excited states in nucleon bonding, would be the ready generation and manipulation of gamma rays without the usual degradation of other means. It is impossible at this time to speculate further on what may come of current colonial research in exotic matter.</div>
