		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">This is the special victory for <span class="color_supremacy_affinity">Supremacy</span>. In this victory, the player constructs a Warp Gate (called the Emancipation Gate) and sends a “liberation army” back to Old Earth to emancipate the denizens from their primitive existence and elevate them into the new, supreme human existence.<br /><br />There are three steps to an Emancipation Victory: contacting Earth, constructing the Emancipation Gate, and sending Military Units through the Emancipation Gate to establish order on Earth.<br /><br />The only way to re-establish contact with Earth is to launch a Lasercom Satellite Orbital Unit.<br /><br />The Emancipation Gate is a Planetary Wonder. After Earth is contacted, the player may build the Emancipation Gate in any City.<br /><br />After the Emancipation Gate is constructed, the <span class="color_supremacy_affinity">Supremacy</span> player uses it to establish control of Earth. They do this by committing Military Units of sufficient strength to the Gate – sending them through to Old Earth to be used as a “peacekeeping force.” To commit a unit to the effort, the player moves the unit onto the Emancipation Gate site and activates the Emancipation Gate’s transport ability. The unit is removed from play after being committed. Every turn, the player can commit only one unit to the Gate.<br /><br />The Combat Strength value of each committed unit is added to the victory progress score. The victory is achieved by reaching a set amount of Combat Strength committed. The player does not lose progress if the Emancipation Gate is destroyed, but they cannot continue with an Emancipation victory until they construct a new Emancipation Gate.</div>
