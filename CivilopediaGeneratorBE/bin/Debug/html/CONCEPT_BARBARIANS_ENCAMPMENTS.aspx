		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Most Aliens come from “nests.” Alien nests will spawn on tiles which have the <img src="/civilopediabe/images/xenomass.png" alt="xenomass" /> Xenomass resource and which haven’t been improved. At regular turn intervals the nest will create another Alien Unit. The only way to stop this is to find the nest and destroy it. Nests are usually guarded by at least one Alien Unit, so they’re not easy to capture.<br /><br />However, you can use nests to become friendly with the aliens if you prefer not destroy them. If you claim a tile where a nest exists and allow it to remain unmolested, the aliens will become less aggressive and eventually friendly to your colony.</div>
