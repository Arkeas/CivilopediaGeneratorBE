		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The architecture and design of launch complexes has remained relatively unchanged since Mankind first sent satellites into orbit around Old Earth. The pre-Seeding spaceports and cosmodromes had launch gantries, runways or landing pads, hangars and storage, and centralized control complexes for oversight; initially built and administered by the government prior to the Great Mistake, a few commercial launch complexes for vertical or horizontal launches had also begun operations. With the efforts to expand into Solar space and exploit the other worlds circling the Sun, launch complexes were also built on the Moon, Mars, Titan, Ganymede and elsewhere. When the Seeding began, given the size of the interstellar ships, Earth’s powers constructed “Node 1” launch complexes in low-Earth orbits for these. The colonies on this world, when ready to return to space, perforce used layouts similar to those perfected in the Solar System. The most challenging aspect of building launch complexes proved to be the scarcity of geologically stable sites; even with underground storage for propellants, the risks of having a complex near a settlement were daunting. Nevertheless, a number were constructed in the traditional style … until advances in mag-lev altered the manner of launching objects into space from this planetary surface.</div>
