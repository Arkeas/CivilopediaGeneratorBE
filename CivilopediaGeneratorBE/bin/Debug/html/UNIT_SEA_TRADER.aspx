		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Once the settlers began to map the lakes and seas and understand the dangers of deep waters on this alien world, colonial officials and merchants began constructing trade vessels to carry trade over the waves to distant ports. In appearance, the colonial ships are not much different from the merchant ships of the past few centuries on Old Earth, being container and tanker vessels festooned with cranes, derricks and pipes. Only the cargo has changed, as energy is the currency of this new world. Thus, besides holds for physical goods, many of the colonial trade vessels carry massive storage devices for loading and offloading electrical, chemical and mechanical energy.</div>
