		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">You can choose to adopt and unlock a Virtue once you have gained enough Culture points, based upon the difficulty level of your game. For example, on the Sputnik difficulty level, the first Virtue unlocks at 10 Culture points but on Gemini, it unlocks with 25 Culture points, with subsequent levels costing a little bit more.<br /><br />Once you have enough Culture, a notification will alert you on your turn. Click on either the notification message or the Virtue icon to bring up the Virtues window.<br /><br />Now you can choose to adopt a new branch or unlock a new Virtue within an unlocked branch. Those you already have will be highlighted; those as yet unselected will be greyed out. Hovering your cursor over a Virtue will provide information on its effects.</div>
