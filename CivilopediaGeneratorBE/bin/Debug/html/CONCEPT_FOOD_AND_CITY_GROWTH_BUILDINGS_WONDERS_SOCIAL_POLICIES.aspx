		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Certain buildings and wonders will affect the amount of Food a city produces or how much it needs in its “bucket” to grow in size.<br /><br />Certain Virtues improve the Production of Food in cities, or lessen the amount deducted from the City Growth Bucket upon population increase. Whereas a player's technology path may be a series of adaptive choices to the environment and circumstances, Virtues represent the player’s long term choices about style and flavor which are more removed from immediate circumstances.</div>
