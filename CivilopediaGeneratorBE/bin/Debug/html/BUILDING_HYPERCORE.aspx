		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The development of computer processors using non-Turing functions was made possible by the engineering of the hypercore, a multi-core quantum CPU capable of handling super-recursive algorithms using “fuzzy logic.” The incorporation of cache coherency circuitry allows it to operate at near-light (theoretically translight) speed for data acquisition and problem solving, permitting simultaneous multithreading. To circumvent the Meissner effect the hypercore required the development of hyperconductors, utilizing one of the peculiarities of firaxite. There are several known models of quantum hypercomputing operation that have been developed by colonial programmers over the three decades since the first functional hypercore was constructed: analog recurrent neural network; Malament-Hogarth spacetime network based on hyper-arithmetical theories; and increasing function oracle that is iterated limiting (k times). Whatever the model followed, the advantages of a hypercore over traditional ones are its processing speed, decision points, directed autonomy, and non-linear analysis. Hypercore computers built thus far by settlements have been variously involved with a number of ultra-complex problems, such as solving any of “supertasks” related to superluminal travel (Benardete’s paradox or Laraudogoitia’s Newtonian indeterminism problem), deciphering the “Signal,” or resolving Aristotle’s actual versus potential infinity distinction. But most of these hypercomputers have been devoted to more mundane research challenges undertaken by colonial scientists in less esoteric disciplines.</div>
