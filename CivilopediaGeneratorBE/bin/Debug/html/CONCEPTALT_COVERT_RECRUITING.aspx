		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In order to recruit agents, the player must first construct the Spy Agency (similar to the Headquarters, each colony can build this but each colony may only have one Spy Agency). This provides the player with three agents at headquarters. These agents can be deployed to other players’ cities to perform covert operations or to your own cities to protect against other players’ covert activities.</div>
