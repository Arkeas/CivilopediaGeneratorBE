		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Features are elements of terrain or vegetation that appear in a hex, atop the hex's terrain. (A grassland hex might have forest or marsh on it as well, for example.) Features modify a hex's productivity and might also alter the amount of "movement points" (MP) a unit expends when entering the hex. Features may also provide defensive combat bonuses or penalties to a unit occupying the hex.</div>
