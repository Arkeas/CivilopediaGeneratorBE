		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">If an agent is moved to a City belonging to the owning player, that agent is performing Counter-Intelligence. Agents conducting Counter-Intelligence cannot perform operations, but make it harder for other agents to do so. A City’s intrigue level also decreases faster when there is a counter-intelligence agent present.</div>
