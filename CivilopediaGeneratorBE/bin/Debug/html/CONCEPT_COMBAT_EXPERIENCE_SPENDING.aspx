		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Once a unit has acquired enough experience points (XPs), the “Promote Unit” button will flash every time the unit is active. If you click on that button, a list of Veterancy benefits available to the unit is displayed. Click on one to choose it. The XPs are expended and the unit acquires the benefit immediately. Any available XP for Veterancy should be spent prior to ending the turn.</div>
