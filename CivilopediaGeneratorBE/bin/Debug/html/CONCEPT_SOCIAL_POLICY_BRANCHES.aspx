		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">A Virtue category is a collection of gameplay bonuses with a common theme.<br /><br />There are four categories of Virtues, each with three levels of depth. These categories are Might, Prosperity, Knowledge and Industry. Structurally, each category is a series of choices stacked on each other to form a column.<br /><br />The topmost Virtues have benefits that are more generally useful, albeit weaker. Virtues deeper in the sequence, by contrast, have more specific or conditional effects which are much stronger.</div>
