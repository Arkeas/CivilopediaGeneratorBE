		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">By the mid-21st Century, the stellar neighborhood of Old Earth had been completely surveyed and mapped, due in large part to the launch of numerous orbital satellites making use of such equipment as wide-field infrared, nanometer spectral, gravitational microlensing, and polarimetric telescopes and sensors. Extensive databases were filled with the information, and these databases accompanied the colonists to the new planets. Once there, using ground-based equipment primarily, the “planetary surveys” were updated and augmented to reflect the new constellations and stellar configurations as observed from the surface. In turn, these “star maps” were utilized by the colonists for a variety of pursuits, from commercial fishing to predictive agriculture to planning the positioning of orbital satellites around this new planet.</div>
