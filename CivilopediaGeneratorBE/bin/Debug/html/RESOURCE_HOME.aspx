			Geologists date this planet as younger than Earth, it being approximately 3.92 billion years since formation, Earth being 4.54 billion years of age. Given that its geologic and atmospheric development is similar to that of Earth, many minerals are common to both and some terrestrial plants are able to thrive when cultivated by colonists. Thus the planet’s resources, both indigenous and transplanted, have proved critical for human settlement, some in strategic terms for expansion and others for improving quality of life as luxuries. While most of these are familiar, others are found only on this world and have unique properties discovered by colonial scientists over the decades since planetfall.
