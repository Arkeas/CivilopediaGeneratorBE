		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Industrial ecology focuses on the shift of industrial processes from a linear (open loop) system to a closed loop system, where waste byproducts of the process become the raw materials of new processes. On this planet, most of the research has been concentrated on industrial metabolism (energy flow studies), dematerialization and decarbonization, industrial symbiosis and eco-efficiency. The most visible aspect of industrial ecology is the eco-industrial parks built recently by a number of colonial settlements. In these, byproducts and waste from mining and agricultural production are utilized in industrial-scale production of new materials. For instance, the waste ore from the mining of floatstone can be used to manufacture micro-abrasives that can alter the magnetic alignment of certain metals on a molecular level. In other plants, agricultural waste is used to create biomaterials used in a vast array of manufacturing techniques. Simultaneously, the eco-industrial parks contribute to the planetary-level terraforming efforts undertaken by some colonial administrations.</div>
