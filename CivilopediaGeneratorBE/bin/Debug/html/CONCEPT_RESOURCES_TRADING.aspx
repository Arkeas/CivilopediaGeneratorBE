		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">While you may not have access to every kind of Strategic Resource within your own borders, you can can gain them through Trade Routes. If another colony has a surplus of a Strategic Resource, creating an international Trade Route to one of their Cities will create copies of that resource for your colony. Your Diplomatic Relationship with that colony must be Cooperative or better for resources to be tradeable. At Cooperative, up to 1 unit of the resource will be traded per Trade Route. If you are Allied, up to 3 units will be traded. You can never gain more units of the resource than the other colony has in its surplus.<br /><br />Basic Resources are not stored by colonies and cannot be traded.</div>
