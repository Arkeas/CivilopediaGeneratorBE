		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Whenever two players go to War, their progress and advantage in that war is tracked by their War Score. A player's score increases each time they score a 'victory' against their enemy -- either killing an enemy unit or conquering an enemy City. The difference between two warring players' War Scores demonstrates whether the war is tied, favoring one player, or being dominated by one player. This difference also controls the terms of making peace, such as whether any spoils will be surrendered by the loser.<br /><br />At all times during a war, the War Score for you and your enemy is displayed in the Diplomacy Overview when viewing the enemy leader.</div>
