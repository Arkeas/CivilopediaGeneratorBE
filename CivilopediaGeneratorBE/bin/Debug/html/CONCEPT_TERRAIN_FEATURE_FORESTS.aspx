		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Forests supply food and raw materials for production. As your city grows there will be a temptation to cut down the forests for farmland, but a wise leader might want to leave some standing — for productivity and defensive purposes. Military units stationed in forests receive a significant defensive bonus.<br /><br />Remember that forest tiles' yield is always 1 food and 1 production, no matter the terrain type or if the tile is hilly.<br /><br />City Yield: 1 food, 1 production<br />Movement Cost: 2<br />Combat Modifier: 25% defensive bonus</div>
