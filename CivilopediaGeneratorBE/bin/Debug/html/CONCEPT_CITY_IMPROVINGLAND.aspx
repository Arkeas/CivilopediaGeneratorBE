		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">While certain tiles naturally provide good amounts of food, Energy, and so forth, many can be “improved” to provide even more, thus increasing a city’s growth, culture, productivity, or science. You need to build “Workers” to improve the lands. Once you have a Worker, you can order it to construct improvements – such as farms, mines, nodes, generators and so forth – that will make the land around your cities more productive.</div>
