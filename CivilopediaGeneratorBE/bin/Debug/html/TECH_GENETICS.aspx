		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">For decades after Gregor Mendel published his famous paper on inherited traits in 1865 AD, the field of genetics was regarded more a curiosity than a science. But the 20th and 21st centuries saw phenomenal advances in mapping genomes, recombinant research, fertilization and reproduction application, and paramutation manipulation. By the time of the colonization efforts, most genetic disorders could be avoided and progress on human adaptive mutations was rapidly exceeding expectations. Most colonial missions included cellular collections and gene libraries to recreate Old Earth species (including humans), either in original form or tailored for the alien environment. In some cases, the colonists pushed the genetic boundaries even further, to the point where their offspring might hardly be recognized as human as they strove to master this planet.</div>
