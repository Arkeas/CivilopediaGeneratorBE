		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">As the colonial governor, you have access to an advisor that is unaffected by emotion or desire: the Ship Computer. If you have elected on the Game Options menu to receive contextualized advisor messages, the Ship Computer will offer suggestions, guidance and advice. It points out things it believes are important, or that you might have forgotten about, based on your current situation and actions.<br /><br />Some advisor messages have buttons linking to a related interstitial tutorial, should you desire additional information.</div>
