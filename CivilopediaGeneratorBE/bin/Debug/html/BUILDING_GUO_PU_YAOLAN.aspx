		<h2>Quote:</h2><div class="infobox">"Miracles are the Divine made manifest in through man’s work. You set to make a warehouse. God Himself has made it a cathedral to His glory through your unseeing eyes, unwilling hands, and unwitting craft."<br />- Thakurite Epistles 6:2-4</div>
		
		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Sleek tunnels, the color of sunlight through a glacier, stretch along the shallow sea-bed and spill into spherical chambers. The gentle fragrance of incense drifts through these halls beneath the sea. A soft, rhythmic chant whispers through the walls. Here, everything is tranquil. This is the Guo Pu Yaolan, a temple complex offering all a serene environment for contemplation and worship.<br /> <br />The complex was originally intended to provide industrial storage to the city above. But once construction was complete and all the lamps surrounding the complex were lit, the ice-smooth corridors scintillated with a blue radiance. All who stood within grew quiet. Chatter hushed. They stood transfixed in the ethereal beauty before them. The space was soon after converted into temples and meditative habitations open to the public, attracting pilgrims seeking peace and spiritual restoration. <br /> <br />A subaquatic atmosphere system was included in the redesign and installed around the central dome, to extend beyond the perimeter of the complex. This system encased the area in a dome of crystal clear water. Ocean life, submarine vessels, and visitors in pressurized suits travelling to and about the complex, appear to gracefully glide through mid-air, flying inside the aura of this sacred place.</div>
