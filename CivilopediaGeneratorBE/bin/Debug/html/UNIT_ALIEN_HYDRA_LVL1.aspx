		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Zoanthus Chemocuscua<br /> <br />The massive hydracoral which populate the ocean are both fascinating and deadly, thanks to the endosymbiotic microbes known as zooxanthellae (or “zoox”) living inside them. The two share a fascinating symbiotic relationship. The hydracoral provide a home for the microscopic zooxanthallae, who in turn provide the hydracoral with a natural defense—a neurotoxin, zetekitoxin C, to which the hydracoral are immune.<br /> <br />In humans, the toxin manifests as a chemical channel blocker, leading to hemorrhaging and paralysis if not treated. It is a molecular analog of the same toxin known to cause shellfish poisoning on earth, saxitoxin.  Some of the symptoms are similar, and, like shellfish poisoning, it is generally advisable to avoid altogether.<br /> <br />The hydracoral, on the other hand, find this toxin to be immensely useful, not only as a defense mechanism, but also as a chemical signal. Its tendrils contain chemoreceptors sensitive to zetekitoxin, which function similarly to taste buds or olfactory receptors. These tendrils, both in the water and in the air, are able to detect and grow towards other sources of the molecule. This allows the hydracoral to grow together into colonies, and thrive in the turbulent ocean.</div>
