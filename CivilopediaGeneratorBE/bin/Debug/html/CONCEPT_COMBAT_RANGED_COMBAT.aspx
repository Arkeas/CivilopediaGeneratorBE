		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Some units such as Rangers, Missile Rovers and Gunboats engage in Ranged Combat (that is, they shoot various things at enemy units) when attacking rather than engaging in melee combat. Such units have two distinct advantages over melee units: first, they can attack enemy units that are not adjacent to them, and second, they cannot take damage when they attack.</div>
