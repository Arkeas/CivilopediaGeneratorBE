		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Colonies can only support a limited number of Military and Civilian Units. You can find how many Units your Colony can support in the Military Overview. The number of Units a Colony can support is dependent on the number of Cities and the total Population. If a Colony has more Units than it can support, it suffers a Production penalty.</div>
