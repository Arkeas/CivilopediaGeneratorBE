		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">When an active Worker unit is in a location where it can do something – say construct a road, build an improvement, or clear land – the Worker Action Panel is visible. This panel displays all actions available to that worker at that location. Click on an action to order the Worker to start building. Worker actions take time; hover the cursor over the action to see how long it will take the Worker to complete that action.</div>
