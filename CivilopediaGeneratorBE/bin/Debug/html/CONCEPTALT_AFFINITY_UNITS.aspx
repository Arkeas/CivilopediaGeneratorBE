		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Some unique military units are aligned with an Affinity type, and will only upgrade to their fullest strength by progression in that Affinity. In turn, only players with that Affinity will be able to build those units; thus, only a player with <span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span> may build or upgrade the Xeno Swarm unit, and the LEV Tank may only be built by a <span class="color_purity_affinity">Purity</span> player.</div>
