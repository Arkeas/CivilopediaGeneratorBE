		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">As the colonial settlements grew, several began to outstrip their available food supplies; whereas in history past this was a limit on population growth, research into the conversion of inorganic wastes into semi-organic, digestible foodstocks proved the solution to raising this limit dramatically on this planet. Simultaneously developed by several colonial institutes, a mix of nano-catalytic processes and genetically engineered anaerobic digesters recover select amino acids, which could be combined to form basic proteins through biosynthesis. The final step in the process is the addition of archaea proteases to trigger hydrolysis of the peptide bonds, producing as an end product a nutritious if relatively flavorless paste. Raw materials for the process include most plastics, rubber, organometallic compounds that contain organic ligands, alkene-derived polymers, and a number of other materials usually discarded after use. Prokaryotic archaea are fairly common on this planet and often found associated with xenomass concentrations. The rate from raw material to protein paste is moderately slow, due primarily to the biosynthesis step; research continues to streamline and speed the process. Industrial complexes that produced protein paste in this manner are termed “mass digesters,” for obvious reasons. While many colonists still prefer organically-grown foods, in many colonies the use of protein paste has become common and is even promoted by the various transhuman movements.</div>
