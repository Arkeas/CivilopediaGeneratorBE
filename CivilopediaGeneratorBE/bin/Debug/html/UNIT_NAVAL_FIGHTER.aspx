		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The early Naval Boats built by colonists were based on plans which had been included in their colonial database. These plans were adapted to the planets prevailing conditions and available materials. The result of these modifications was a combat vessel, 30 meters in length, armed with directed-energy weapons and a variety of secondary armaments, such as torpedoes and surface-to-air missiles.<br /><br />Although originally driven by CODAG engines, which made use of local petroleum, the ships were eventually augmented to support nuclear power. This development gave way to a variety of new ship classes, both large and small. Larger vessels were capable of carrying heavy Particle-Beam ordnance, which proved particularly useful against larger sea creatures. Smaller Patrol Ships were primarily used for exploration and contact with other colonies.<br /><br />Although capable of operating independently, these Gunboats were often formed into flotillas of varying size. In times of Colonial warfare, the flotillas usually served as escorts for Carriers and Transports.<br /><br />Interestingly, of all the colonial military branches, it is the Navy which remained the least changed. Although they now operated on an alien world, their mission and activity was nearly indistinguishable from what it had been on old Earth.</div>
