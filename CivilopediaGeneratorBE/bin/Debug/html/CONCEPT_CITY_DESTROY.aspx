		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">If you raze the city, it’s gone. Forever. All of its buildings, wonders, and citizens are no more. While there are some valid reasons for razing a city, mostly to do with your population’s health, this extreme behavior does have significant diplomatic consequences – i.e., other colonies may be less likely to ally with you if they think you’re a bloodthirsty conqueror. You can raze the city immediately upon capturing it or at any point after that.</div>
