		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Cities are vital to your colony's success. They are the site to build Units, Buildings and Wonders. They allow you to research new technologies and gather wealth, expanding your borders as they do so. You cannot win Beyond Earth without at least one secure, well-situated city. As the number of cities in your colony grows, your colony’s Health declines.<br /><br />In other words, a colony with two cities each of population 1 is less healthy than a colony with one city of population 2, even though you have the same total population.</div>
