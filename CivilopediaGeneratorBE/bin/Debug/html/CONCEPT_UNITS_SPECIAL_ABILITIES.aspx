		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Many units have special abilities, allowing them to do some things better than other units, or to do some things that other units cannot do at all. Colonist units can found Outposts, for example, and no other units can do so. A Ranger unit can deal “ranged” damage, allowing it to attack an enemy that is not adjacent to it, while most combat units cannot. Orbital units have a range of distinct abilities.</div>
