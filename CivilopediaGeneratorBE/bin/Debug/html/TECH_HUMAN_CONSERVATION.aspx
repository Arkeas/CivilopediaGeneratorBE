		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">“Human Conservation” has come to refer to the philosophy of retaining “what it means to be human” as a species; it is the latest expression of Old Earth humanism, which promoted the value, nature and agency of human beings, both individually and collectively. Following the Great Mistake, humanism fell out of favor for more dramatic belief systems; many felt at the time that, along with secularism and utilitarianism, humanism had a role in what had transpired. But as some colonial settlements on this planet have taken paths that diverge dramatically from “human” in form and function, other colonial and spiritual leaders feel such “posthumans” are no longer human. In the view of the latter, it is critical for Mankind to not surrender human reason, the human form, metaphysical naturalism and altruistic morality in its efforts to improve. Followers of the “human conservation” philosophy seek to insure this through maintaining “pure” human culture, physiology and history through repositories and organizations scattered about this planet.</div>
