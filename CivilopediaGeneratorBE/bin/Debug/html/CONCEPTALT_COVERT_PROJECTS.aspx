		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">When the player gets Agents for the first time, he or she is asked to select a National Security Project. National Security Projects provide a passive global benefit to the player which scales depending on the number of Agents that are at Headquarters (the more Agents at Headquarters, the better the yield from the Project).<br /><br />National Security Projects never "complete," but are ongoing and continuously beneficial. The player can change the current Project at any time, but there is a number of turns before the Project will become active, during which time no Project is active.</div>
