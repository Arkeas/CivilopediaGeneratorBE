		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">In a sociological sense, the philosophy of idealism asserts that human thought is the only reality, that humans are the only sentient beings, and – in transcendental idealism – that the human mind shapes the world. By the time human survival on this planet was assured, many colonists had turned to the writings of neo-Platonists, Kant, Hegel, and other Old Earth philosophers for understanding and guidance regarding the evolutionary path they should pursue. Their views on Mankind’s progress towards transhumanity and posthumanity, on its role as arbiter of reality, and on its ability and “right” to re-make the cosmos in its own image resonated with colonial philosophers and sociologists. Proponents of each of the divergent “affinities” found some justification for their beliefs, and coupled tenets from the many branches of human idealism with the scientific progress towards their envisioned “utopia” on this world.</div>
