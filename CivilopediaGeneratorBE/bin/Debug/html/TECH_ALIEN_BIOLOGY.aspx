		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">With the establishment of the first settlements, colonial biologists finally had the opportunity to study extrasolar life under more-or-less Earthlike conditions. Beginning from the studies of extremophiles on Old Earth, colonial biologists sought to progress through the discovery and classification of fauna on this world in a logical progression, from abiogenesis to taphonomy to biosphere. Initially, study of the current native lifeforms was limited to dissection and the extremely rare living specimens. In a matter of years, however, research in alien biology expanded into the realms of ethology, homeostasis, genetics, mycology, pathology and many others. As with most initial research on this planet, the goal was to learn how to survive and thrive here; only in recent decades has colonial study of the alien lifeforms turned to uncovering how to adapt to co-existence within a shared biosphere.</div>
