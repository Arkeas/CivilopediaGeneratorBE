		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">All military units have three basic statistics (stats): movement speed, Combat Strength, and Upgrades. Non-military units (Colonists, Workers, Trade Convoys, and such) have only movement speed and a Combat Strength of zero. Orbital units have neither, in that they are placed in orbit over a specific hex, and do not engage in combat directly (although some permit orbital bombardment of targets on the surface).</div>
