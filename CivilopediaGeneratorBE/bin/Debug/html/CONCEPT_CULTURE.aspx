		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox"><img src="/civilopediabe/images/culture.png" alt="culture" /> Culture is a measurement of your colony’s commitment to and appreciation of the arts and humanities … and the memories of Old Earth. More than one colony in history has had a richness of resources but a dearth of the finer things.<br /><br />The main effect of Culture is to allow you to purchase new Virtues. Virtues are specialized abilities or rewards that allow you to customize your colony's strengths and advantages. Additionally, Culture is the source of territory for land-based cities. The land city will gain new plots based on how much Culture it creates, naturally increasing your territory over time. Culture does not influence the territory of aquatic cities, however.</div>
