		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Resistance occurs only after the player chooses to Annex a conquered city. While in Resistance, the city decreases the colony's health significantly. Resistance is in effect for a set number of turns, based on the city’s population. Resistance can be in effect at the same time as Martial Law if the player conquers a city and chooses to annex either immediately or on any subsequent turn before the Martial Law effect expires.</div>
