		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Health is a measure of your colony's overall well-being. It is a tug of war between sources of positive Health and sources of negative Health. Depending on what your overall Health level is, you can gain penalties or bonuses. In general, a larger population causes more negative Health, and will require more effort to keep in check.<br /><br />Your colony’s overall Health is displayed on the Status Bar of the Main Screen (across the top of the Main Map screen). Watch it carefully. If it is red, your population is Unhealthy and may require attention. If it is green, your population is fine, and may even be receiving bonuses. (You can get an excellent report of your population’s Health, and any bonuses or penalties, by hovering your cursor over this number.)<br /><br />A population with negative overall Health will experience penalties, which get worse as Health deteriorates. On the other hand, positive Health grants bonuses to your population, which get better as Health improves further.</div>
