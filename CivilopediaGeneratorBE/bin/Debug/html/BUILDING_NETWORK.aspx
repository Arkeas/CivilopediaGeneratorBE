		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">As soon as feasible, colonial administrations established computer networks similar to those on Old Earth at the time of the Seeding. Since the ancient days of ARPANET, modern life has been driven by the data-interface exchange of the many types of networked computers; without this ability research, education, medicine, all human activities would revert to the Information Dark Ages of the early 20th Century. Although small compared to the systems on pre-Seeding Earth, the first networks yet contained dozens of network nodes, many of these portable quantum supercomputers that had been salvaged and re-tasked from the colony ships. While the architecture of the various networks varied considerably, the basic utility did not; it can be said that without the networks, no colony would have survived, much less prospered. As on Earth, when telecom satellites were eventually put into orbit, the self-enclosed networks were linked and a planet-spanning network has evolved. The latest developments in non-uniform memory access, cellular architecture, and vector processors since planetfall continue to upgrade the networks, and have allowed those colonies adopting the Supremacy ideology to even interface their citizenry.</div>
