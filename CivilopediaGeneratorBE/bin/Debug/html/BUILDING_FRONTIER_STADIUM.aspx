		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">According to recovered documents from Old Earth, people watched and played a variety of sports. This practice has since been lost and has given way to other spare time activities. In order to revive this old tradition of sports, the Frontier Stadium is a place where people can watch traditional Earth sports in action. Though there are no professionals, many of the players are training to become soldiers.</div>
