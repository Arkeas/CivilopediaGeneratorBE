		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Favors are a form of diplomatic currency that offers players more insight and control over their long-term relationships with other colonial leaders. Favors can only be acquired and expended through the diplomacy Trade screen, and are only offered by AI opponents.<br /><br />Think of Favors as a form of an IOU, or a promise to repay the Favor with tangible goods or action later on.<br /><br />How can you gain Favors?<br /><br />If an AI player makes a request of a human player, they may offer one or more Favors as immediate repayment. In this way, requests are never granted “for free” in Civilization: Beyond Earth, but always come with Favors as evidence of the AI’s promise to repay the player for their good will in granting the request. When the request is proposed, the player will see how many Favors they would receive for granting it. The player can then trade these Favors back later for goods or services.<br /><br />Favors are not limited to the Deals area. You can also use them in the Discussion area to make sure a request to an AI opponent has a positive outcome.</div>
