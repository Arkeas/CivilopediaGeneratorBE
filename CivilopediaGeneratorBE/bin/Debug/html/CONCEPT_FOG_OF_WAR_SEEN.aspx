		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">You can always see everything within your borders, as well as one tile away from your borders. Most units can see everything within 2 tiles (except for tiles behind mountains and blocking tiles). Units on hills can see over blocked tiles. Certain promotions will extend a unit's sight by 1 tile, and also, a number of mid- to late-game naval units have extended sight as well.</div>
