		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Cities thrive due to the land around them. Their citizens “work” the land, harvesting Food, Energy, Production and Science from the tiles. Citizens can work tiles that are within three tiles’ distance from the city and that are within your colony’s borders. Only one city can work a single tile even if it’s within two tiles’ distance from more than one.</div>
