		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The Trade Screen allows you to trade items and to enter into other kinds of treaties. Some options require knowledge of certain technologies before you use them. If you cannot trade something, it is greyed out. Hover your cursor over a line to learn more about it.<br /><br />The Trade Screen is divided into two sides. Your colony’s offer is on the right side, and the other colony’s is on the left.<br /><br />Trades do not need to be equal: you can, for example, ask for “Open Borders” in return for some amount of energy, or nothing at all. Once you’ve set up the trade you want, click on the “Propose” button to present it to the other colony. If the other leader accepts the offer it goes into effect immediately.<br /><br />If the other leader rejects it (note his/her response in the dialog box upper right), you can click on “What would make this deal work?” to ask what the leader wants. There are times when the AI leader will never give up certain items, no matter how beneficial your offer. Sometimes the other leader will make you an offer. You can accept the offer or make a counter-offer or decline it altogether. Click on the “Back” button to leave this screen.<br /><br />Trade agreements, unless immediately resolved, last 30 turns. You may, of course, then renegotiate the agreement.</div>
