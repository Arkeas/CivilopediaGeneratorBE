		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Alien Nests generate additional aliens that have a wide range of abilities, including Melee, Ranged, and Siege.<br /><br />Once created the alien units will either remain close to their nest or wander the terrain. They generally will not attack humans unless a human is close to a nest, or if a human has been killing them in large numbers. If this occurs, the aliens will become very aggressive, and if enough are involved, they can take down a poorly-defended city.</div>
