		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Military units can engage in combat against other units or against outposts or cities. Most military units are “melee units,” meaning that they can attack only enemies in hexes directly adjacent to them. Some military units are “ranged units,” meaning that they can indirectly attack enemies one or more hexes away.</div>
