<h2>Early Life</h2><div class="infobox">The most celebrated cosmonaut since Yuri Gagarin, Vadim Kozlov came from a working-class family but rose to heroic stature in the years before the Seeding. Eldest son of parents who labored as itinerant steelworkers and welders, Vadim acquired his limited formal education in industrial cities scattered across the Federation: Krakow, Bydgoszcz, Lublin, Minsk, Vitebsk, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk. Vadim answered the call for construction volunteers issued by Roscosmos, the resurgent Federation space agency. Minimally trained in zero-G construction methods, Kozlov was sent to work on building the second Federation Earth-orbit station. He was soon promoted to foreman of his shift due to his aptitude for weightless labor combined with practical experience in heavy construction.</div>
<h2>Career in Space</h2><div class="infobox">Inducted into the armed forces and immediately given the rank of Colonel, Vadim took advantage of part-time educational programs to gain a comp-diploma in aerospace engineering. Over the next decade, he became the public face of the Federation efforts to exploit the vast resources of space. Vadim Kozlov was the first citizen of the Federation to set foot on Mars. For this, he was made a “Hero of the People” and promoted to General in Roscosmos. Six years later, he led the mission to map Sol’s asteroid belt in preparation for mining operations; for this success, Kozlov was awarded a second Hero’s medal and promoted again.</div>
<h2>Success</h2><div class="infobox">Incredibly popular among the working class, a devoted family man, and fiercely loyal to the Slavic state that had rewarded his hard work, Kozlov eschewed offers to enter politics or move into the civilian realm. At the age of 35, he was overseeing Roscosmos construction projects on Earth, Mars, and in space. He was not reticent in pitching in personally to do manual labor during inspections of construction sites on Earth, elevating his reputation even more as a self-effacing, self-made, successful servant of the people. Both professionally and personally, Vadim Kozlov appeared content.</div>
<h2>Return to Space</h2><div class="infobox">Yet Vadim made no effort to disguise his desire to return to space. In his early 40s, when the Slavic colonization effort was launched, Kozlov volunteered to head one of the missions. He was promptly accepted, and threw himself into the role of mission commander with the vigor and consummate professionalism for which he was famed. It has been surmised that he was urged to volunteer by his beloved wife, who hoped to give their children opportunities on a new world not available in the overcrowded and calcifying Slavic Federation. Whatever the truth of such rumors, in the colony mission, Kozlov was able to combine all the loves of his life: space travel, exploration, engineering, family, and Federation.</div>
