		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">A fully-healthy city has 100 hit points. As it takes damage, the city’s hit points are reduced. When a city’s hit points reach “0,” an enemy unit may enter the city, regardless of any units already inside. When this occurs, the city is captured. The attacker usually has the option of destroying the city or adding the city to his colony, either as a puppet or directly through annexation.<br /><br />When your unit enters an enemy city, you have three choices: you can raze the city, you can annex it and make it part of your colony, or you can make it into a puppet city. Each has its own benefits and costs.<br /><br />If a city is captured, its buildings are captured as well, although these may not remain. The city’s culture and military buildings (defense perimeter, alien preserve, and so forth) are always destroyed when the city is taken. All other buildings have a 66% chance of being captured intact and remaining in play under your control.</div>
