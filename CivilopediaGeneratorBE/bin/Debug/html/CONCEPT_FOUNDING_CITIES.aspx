		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox"><span class="color_positive_text">Cities</span> come from building new <span class="color_positive_text">Outposts</span> and sheltering them until they grow into Cities.<br /><br />Building an Outpost, the precursor to a City, is the sole action available to the Colonist unit. Building an Outpost consumes the Colonist. An Outpost may be founded anywhere on the map within these restrictions:<br /><br />[ICON_BULLET]The Outpost cannot be closer than 3 tiles to another City or Outpost<br />[ICON_BULLET]The Outpost cannot be closer than 2 to a Station<br />[ICON_BULLET]The Outpost cannot be established along the edge of the map<br /><br />Once established, the Outpost starts with just one tile of claimed territory, selected from whichever unclaimed tiles adjacent to the Outpost’s location are judged most valuable. From its initial claimed tile, the Outpost will steadily claim all remaining, unclaimed tiles around it, similar to the way a land City’s Culture output will expand its territory. After all the tiles adjacent the Outpost are claimed -- whether by that Outpost or by another Outpost or City -- it will transform into a full City.</div>
