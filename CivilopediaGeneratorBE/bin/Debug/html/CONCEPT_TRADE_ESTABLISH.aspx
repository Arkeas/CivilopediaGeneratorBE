		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In order to establish a Trade Route, the City first needs a Trade Depot and an available Trade Route slot. These slots allow the City to establish Trade Routes via land or sea. Once the city has a Trade Depot and an open slot, build a Trade Convoy or a Trade Vessel.<br /><br />With the Trade Convoy or Trade Vessel unit selected, click on its “Establish Trade Route” order. The trade route screen will open, listing all cities, outposts, and stations available to be traded with. Each destination shows the benefits to both parties.<br /><br />Select the destination you wish this trade route to reach and it will be automatically established. Trade routes ignore ownership of tiles when established.</div>
