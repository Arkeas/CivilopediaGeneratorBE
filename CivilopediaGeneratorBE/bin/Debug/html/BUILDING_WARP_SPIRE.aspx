		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Transporting large quantities of goods on a new planet is a challenge. A brand new solution for this problem is the Warp Spire. Using an advanced form of laser technology, these large towers have the ability to create a form of anti-friction tunnel that can receive large quantities of cargo between two points as long as there is no obstruction between them. The enormous rate of speed achievable led to their being nicknamed 'warp' towers, after the fictitious faster-than-light travel from Old Earth entertainment.</div>
