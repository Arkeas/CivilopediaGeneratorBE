		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">An orbital unit must be launched from a city tile to a tile that has launch coverage. Once launched, orbital units are placed in the orbital layer map. These can be launched to a tile that already has a ground or naval unit, but not another orbital unit.<br /><br />Launch coverage is provided for the player over certain areas automatically, such as the areas surrounding his/her cities. Other additions to launch coverage can be earned through technologies, wonders, virtues, buildings, station contracts, and so forth.<br /><br />Orbital units cannot occupy the same tile in the orbital layer. In other words, orbital units obey the one unit per tile rule with other orbital units. Additionally, the skirts of orbital units cannot overlap.</div>
