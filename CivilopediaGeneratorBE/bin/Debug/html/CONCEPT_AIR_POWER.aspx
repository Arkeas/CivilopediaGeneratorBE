		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">By the time of the Great Mistake, air power – along with the low-orbit satellites – dominated the battlefield, and warfare in general. Whether manned or unmanned, aircraft of many types conducted reconnaissance, bombing, interdiction, strafing, and many other military activities. Although most colonial missions could not bring aircraft in their cargo and had to build them, and while there were some aerodynamic differences, within a short period air power was again a crucial component of the military forces of any settlement.</div>
