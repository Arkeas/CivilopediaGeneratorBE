		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Alien nests can appear anywhere that Xenomass is found. If you want to keep local aliens at bay, you may want to clear the nests as quickly as possible after they show up.<br /><br />However, if you own the tile where the nest is located and allow it to remain, it will gradually improve the aliens' attitude towards your colony. Eventually, this can cause the aliens to become friendly to you.</div>
