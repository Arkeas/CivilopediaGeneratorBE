		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Players can attack Stations at any point, but on their first attempt they will receive a message asking them to confirm the declaration of hostility. If they confirm, they will be set as “Openly Hostile” to the station. Once hostile, all future attacks made against the station will be permitted automatically in the manner of open war with another colony. However, the station will never again support trade with the player, and other trading partners with the station may adjust their diplomatic opinion based on the aggression.<br /><br />In addition to their trade interactions, all stations provide a reward if conquered. When a station is captured, it is cleared from the map in the same manner as a nest, and grants the conquering player a one-time effect based on the station’s type, level, and status.</div>
