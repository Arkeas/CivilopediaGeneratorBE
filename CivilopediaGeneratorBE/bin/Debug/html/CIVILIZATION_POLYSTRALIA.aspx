<h2>Rising Tide</h2><div class="infobox">The ecological disaster and rising sea levels that followed the Great Mistake first affected the people of the Pacific. Low-lying islands were inundated, coastal communities were threatened, and rivers were choked by saltwater upflow. Wildlife underwent upheaval, and commercial aquaculture was seriously disrupted. Those coastal countries, from Indonesia to the Polynesian archipelagos, joined together in the first new pan-national body, united by the common threat from the sea. The new body, christened Polystralia, spanned a larger geographic area than any other nation of Old Earth, but with a smaller population and fewer land resources. The Polystralians would have to face their problems with ingenuity, not wealth.</div>
<h2>Leading by Example</h2><div class="infobox">Focused on practical progress, the Polystralians tackled the engineering challenges and food situation with a charming directness. Focusing on small, individually driven projects, iterating quickly and sharing success stories with each other, the Polystralians quickly became leaders in "dry" horticulture and aquaculture. To say that Polystralia fed the world after the Great Mistake may be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. Treaties and trade agreements brought food to many struggling peoples in exchange for raw materials and manufactured goods that the islands lacked.</div>
<h2>Humanitarian Traders</h2><div class="infobox">The wealth earned from feeding the world went into building a national shipping fleet that was the envy of the world, and Polystralian-flagged vessels soon carried the supermajority of the world's cargo. This in turn further enriched the country, but instead of squandering their wealth, Polystralian financial institutions lent money at favorable rates to help in worldwide reconstruction and reclamation projects, backed by a stable currency. The Commonwealth was also at the fore in humanitarian relief efforts in devastated regions, earning it yet more goodwill. Over the next generations, Polystralian diplomats and politicians would serve as moderators and overseers in most international disputes. Polystralia embodied the Samoan proverb: Amuia le masina, e alu ma sau (“Stones rot but not deeds”).</div>
<h2>The Commonwealth</h2><div class="infobox">Much of Polystralia’s prosperity and progress was due to its lack of internal political discord. Unlike other areas, the relations between the nation-members of the Commonwealth were generally cordial and peaceful. Disputes were settled amicably in the Assembly. With the exception of a unified judiciary and military, and contributions to the operating cost of the Commonwealth government, local administration is left in the hands of the member states. For over a century this structure elevated Polystralia into the ranks of superpowers.</div>
<h2>Far and Away</h2><div class="infobox">Although less active in the off-world colonization effort than other states, Polystralia also joined the race to spread humanity to other planets. With unpleasant memories of the penal colonies founded in many of its lands, the Commonwealth focused on the well-being and safety of its colonists before other concerns. Motivated by a historical sense of adventure and exploration, as well as a tradition of hard work and self-reliance, tens of thousands of Commonwealth citizens volunteered to relocate off-world. With its extensive research in agriculture, ecology, and alternative energy sources, and a cultural tradition of traveling immense distances to settle in new lands, the several colonial efforts sought to live in accord with the new environments, and thus replicate Polystralia’s prosperity and peace in far-distant islands of space.</div>
