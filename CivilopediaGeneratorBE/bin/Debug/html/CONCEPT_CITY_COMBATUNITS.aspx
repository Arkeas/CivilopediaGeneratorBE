		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">A city’s owner may “garrison” a military unit inside the city to bolster its defenses. A portion of the garrisoned unit’s Combat Strength is added to the city’s strength. The garrisoned unit will take no damage when the city is attacked; however, if the city is captured the garrisoned unit is destroyed.<br /><br />Only one combat unit may occupy a city at a time. That military unit is said to “garrison” the city, and it adds a defensive bonus to the city. Additional combat units may move through the city, but they cannot end their turn there.</div>
