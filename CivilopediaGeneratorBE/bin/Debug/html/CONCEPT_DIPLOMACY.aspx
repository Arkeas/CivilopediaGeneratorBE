		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">While playing Beyond Earth, you can accomplish a lot through diplomacy. You can gain allies and isolate your enemies. You can create defensive and offensive pacts. You can end wars that are going badly for you. You can bluff the credulous and bully the timid.<br /><br />Sometimes it really is better to talk than to fight – at least until their back is turned and you’re ready to launch the knife. But, be warned, everything you do will have repercussions in your future dealings… not just with your victim but with all the other leaders as well.</div>
