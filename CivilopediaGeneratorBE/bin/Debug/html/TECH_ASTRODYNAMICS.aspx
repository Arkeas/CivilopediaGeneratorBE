		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The application of celestial mechanics to practical matters concerning orbital flight and interstellar mapping lately has become one of the most vital topics of research for the colonies. As the colonists contemplated a return to space, astrodynamics – founded on the ancient laws of Newton and Kepler – laid out the unvarying formulae of free, circular, elliptical, parabolic and hyperbolic orbits. But advances in design and energy sources, coupled with the differences in mass and rotational period of this planet compared to Old Earth, meant that velocities and orbital periods could be increased and shortened respectively. Soon enough, satellites of every sort circled overhead. This in turn triggered a new interest in the “geography” of near space among the citizens in many settlements; the result was a plentitude of new planetariums and research grants devoted to the heavens as many felt manned space missions would occur within their lifetime.</div>
