		<h2>Game Info:</h2><div class="infobox">Life will recognize life. It was easy for humanity to point to other creatures and recognize their existence. Humans were willing to anthropomorphize things that are not even alive, so eager were they to find life and celebrate it. Earth was a dying world, but the colonists made planetfall on a world that overflowed with life, strange and hostile as it may have been. In this life they began to recognize not just the mark of existence, but the hidden mark of intention and genius.<br /><br />Meta-analysis of alien ecosystem behavior and behavioral paleontology projects were able to identify that the planet itself had a holistic organization that could produce intelligence. Human sciences eventually led to the creation of models that allowed an understanding of how this intelligence might function. At that point, to contact this intelligence, it was necessary to have life recognize life, through life that could think in the same scope and scale as a planet-wide megaorganism. To this end, the Mind Flower was created.<br /><br />It was a strange flower indeed, and did not resemble the fruiting flowers of either world. It was instead a great Lotaxl tank (no other artificial ontological system would work on that scale), within which was the greatest mass of neural tissue ever created, dense with neurons, whose dendritic connections would have outnumbered the stars of the universe, because only life can create itself on the scale needed for such projects. Connected and embedded through this tissue were the cybernetics needed to interpret the thoughts, to scope them to something as limited as human understanding. Then the Mind Flower was exposed, slowly, to the strange architecture of the planet, shaping itself to match its rhythms and tides. Once it had mapped these, it took the intervention of human consciousness to blend the two.<br /><br />Thus was the planet awakened to the presence of man, and humanity brought within the sea of understanding that this planet represented. The concepts of "I" and "Thou" and "We" no longer make sense, because it is all part of the same thought, the same dream, the same aspiration. We have fulfilled the promise that might have come to us on Earth, had it been able to sustain life in this way. The Mind Flower has blossomed, and the fruit it yielded is a planet which understands, and sees, and thinks, and reaches out, and recognizes things that the tiny "individuals" that dwelled on its surface might never have seen. Only in unification can the necessary perspective be gained. Only in the whole lives truth.</div>
