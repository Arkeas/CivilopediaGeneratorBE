		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In order to protect against external covert threats, intelligence agencies can create comprehensive systems to analyze the behavioral patterns of the citizens they protect. These networks identify individuals whose behavior is atypical and possibly subversive, then trace the social connections of those individuals in an effort to identify unfriendly or unauthorized intelligence activities. Unpopular in societies which cling to old Terran notions of privacy and individual freedom, they are none the less demonstrably effective in rooting out nests of spies.</div>
