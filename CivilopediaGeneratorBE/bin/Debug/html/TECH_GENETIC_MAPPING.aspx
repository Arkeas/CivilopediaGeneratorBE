		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">By the end of the 21st Century, the genome of virtually every plant and animal species on Old Earth had been mapped, and the quantitative trait loci identified. Efforts to do the same for indigenous species on this world began immediately upon establishment of the first labs, starting with the large fauna and potential food sources among the flora. Within a few years, an inter-colonial cooperative database of DNA sequences had been launched, although some scientists used the Maxim-Gilbert sequencing method and others the Sanger chain-termination method. This database would serve as the essential reference for later research in genetic design, transgenetics, and artificial evolution. Meanwhile, some Purist colonial administrations maintained repositories of the genome maps of Old Earth species (including human) for potential uses in cloning, cybernetic, and transhuman projects.</div>
