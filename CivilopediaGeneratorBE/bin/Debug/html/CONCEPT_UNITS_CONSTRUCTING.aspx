		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Units are built in cities. Each unit has a certain “Production Cost” which determines how many points of Production the city must expend to produce the unit. In addition, in order to construct a unit you must have knowledge of the requisite technology (you must know the “Physics” technology, for example, to construct a “Ranger” unit). Some units also require that your colony have access to certain resources to construct them (for instance, to build a “LEV Tank” you will need Floatstone).</div>
