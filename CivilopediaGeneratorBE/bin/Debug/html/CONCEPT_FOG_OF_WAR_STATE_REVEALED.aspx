		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">If you have uncovered the fog of war from a tile but cannot see it at the present moment (because the exploring unit has moved away, for instance), the tile is slightly darkened. You can still see the terrain in the tile, but you will not see any units in the tile. You may not see any improvements, recently-constructed cities, and so forth. Basically, your information about that tile may be well out of date.</div>
