		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Architects are genetically enhanced commanders, surveying the battlefield and devising tactics based on tons of data on the fly. Every Architect has received extensive cerebral gene modification that enhances their cognitive function well beyond that of a normal human. The implants and gene therapy they have received allow their brains to operate several times faster, processing large amounts of information very quickly, as well as giving them heightened senses. Architects also carry large scanners with them, allowing them to gather data about their surroundings in a wide area.<br /><br />The data that Architects collect through sensory perception and their scanners ranges from variations in weather patterns to topography to the location and condition of both their own forces as well as the enemy’s. They analyze this at speeds similar to that of supercomputers, determining all advantages and disadvantages on both sides, and make strategic decisions within seconds that exploit everything in play to give themselves and their own troops the best possible outcome.<br /><br />It is essential that these commanders are on the front lines of battle with their forces, where they are able to collect and analyze the most raw data and then relay their brilliant strategies back within moments. Non-enhanced soldiers that have seen Architects in play say that their tactical decision making is awe-inspiring and easily turns the tide of battle.</div>
