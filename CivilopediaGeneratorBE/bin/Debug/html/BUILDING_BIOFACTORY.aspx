		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Colonial biofactories were established as the colonists began to grasp the potential of the lifeforms native to this planet. For thousands of years, Mankind has used biotechnology – the use of organisms to produce chemicals and materials – in agriculture and medicine. In the late 21st Century, faced with environmental concerns and dwindling resources, scientists on Old Earth applied new and traditional techniques to the industrial production of genomes, synthetics, metals, textiles, biorobotics and biofuels. After planetfall, vast expanses of coral, fungi and algae were surveyed and catalogued, but it was several generations before these could be exploited to their fullest. Biofactories now use coral deposits harvested from the seas of this planet to produce construction materials, filters, pharmaceuticals, rare minerals and of course jewelry. Although the primary use is as a biofuel base, algae are the source of most of the colonial production of agars, alginates, fertilizers, food concentrates and many pigments. And the biotech uses of the indigenous fungi, so plentiful and varied on this world, are virtually endless, with new ones being discovered annually. Notable among the latter are biofactories using native fungal species to make polyamide microfibers and thermal and nano-electrical insulations, vital in quantum computers and autonomous robots and mag-lev vehicles.</div>
