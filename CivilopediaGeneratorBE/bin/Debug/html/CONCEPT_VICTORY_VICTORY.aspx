		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">There are multiple paths to victory in Civilization: Beyond Earth. Three are “universal,” meaning any player can achieve them in any game. Three are “Affinity specialization” victories, each relating to a different Affinity. Thus, in any game, you have four methods of achieving victory: Contact, Domination, Time, and your specific Affinity victory.</div>
