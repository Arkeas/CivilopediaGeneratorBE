		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">To target a city with a ranged unit, move the unit so that the city falls within the unit’s line of sight range and then right-click on the city. Depending upon the power behind the attack, the city’s hit points may be reduced by the attack. Note that a ranged attack cannot drop a city below 1 HP: the city must be captured by a melee unit.</div>
