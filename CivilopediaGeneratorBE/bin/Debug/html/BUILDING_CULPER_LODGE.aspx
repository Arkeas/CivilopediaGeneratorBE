		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">During the American Revolution on Old Earth the American Major Benjamin Tallmadge organized a spy ring based in New York City during 1778 AD, providing information on the British occupation forces to General George Washington, commander of the revolutionary troops. Cloaked in secrecy, over the next few years the Culper Ring provided vital information to the Continentals, inventing and perfecting many methods for doing so. Supposedly disbanded at the end of the conflict, in fact several of the most successful agents – known within the ring only by code names – maintained contact and eventually formed the “Culper Lodge,” a clandestine enterprise devoted to covert operations for hire. Over the next two centuries the Lodge not only conducted operations under contract but also developed their own training and technology branches. Although various corporations and governments made use of their services, by Great Mistake the Culper Lodge remained a mystery to most yet. It was inevitable, it seems, that at the time of the Seeding several members of the Lodge managed to insert themselves into the colony missions being launched. Since planetfall, the Culper Lodge has reestablished itself as a supplier of highly trained agents, willing to undertake almost any clandestine mission.</div>
