		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Aquatic cities work just like land cities, but with three key differences.<br /><br />First, aquatic cities [COLOR_RED]do not grow with <img src="/civilopediabe/images/culture.png" alt="culture" /> Culture</span>. They only claim the plots adjacent to the city when the city is founded. Instead, to claim new territory, aquatic cities require their second special ability:<br /><br />[COLOR_GREEN]Aquatic cities can move.</span> These cities float and can travel around the map. Whenever the city moves, it claims the tiles adjacent to its new location. This is how aquatic cities gain their territory. They can still buy plots with <img src="/civilopediabe/images/energy.png" alt="energy" /> Energy, however.<br /><br />Lastly, although aquatic cities do not grow with <img src="/civilopediabe/images/culture.png" alt="culture" /> Culture, they do produce 50% more <img src="/civilopediabe/images/culture.png" alt="culture" /> Culture towards unlocking new Virtues.</div>
