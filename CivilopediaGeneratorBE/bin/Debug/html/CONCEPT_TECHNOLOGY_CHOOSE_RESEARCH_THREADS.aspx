		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The branch technologies in the web are organized around threads, which can be thought of as concepts or disciplines that are all part of a common “idea family.” Each of these threads connects laterally with related threads to form the web, allowing players to move sideways among similar threads to explore the technologies they find most compelling without necessarily needing to backtrack and fill in unrelated prerequisites.</div>
