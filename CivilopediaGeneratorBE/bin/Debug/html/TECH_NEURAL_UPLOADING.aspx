		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Whole brain emulation – better known as “neural uploading” – is the process of copying mental content from a particular brain substrate to a quantum-based computational device. This may be accomplished in one of two methods: copy-and-transfer, or gradual replacement of neurons. In the former, scanning the salient mental contents of a biological brain to create a holistic simulation, which can then be stored in a virtual reality program of a quantum computer or a robot equipped with one. The latter method involves the transplanting of the biological brain into a mechanical shell, whereupon the neurons are slowly replaced by nano-bytes linked with synthetic synapses. Colonial futurists, discounting the ethical arguments, argue that neural uploading is the logical endpoint to transhumanism, and that a society of uploads would reach an indeterminate point whereupon a technological singularity would result. Before that, proponents claim that neural uploads would grant a measure of immortality to individuals, as well as speed the functioning of the “brain” to as much as five million “action potentials” per neuron per second (as compared to the average of 1000 in a biological brain).</div>
