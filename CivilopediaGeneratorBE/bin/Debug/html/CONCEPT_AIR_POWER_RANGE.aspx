		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In place of a movement stat, Air Units have "range." This is the distance from a base that they can perform "missions." For example, a Tacjet unit has a range of 4. It can perform its missions against any tile within 4 spaces of its current base, and it can move to another player owned base (City or Carrier) that is within 8 spaces.<br /><br />An Air Unit that rebases cannot perform another mission in the same turn.</div>
