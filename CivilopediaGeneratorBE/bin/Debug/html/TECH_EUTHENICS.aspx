		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Although not formalized until the 1920s AD, the field of euthenics postulates that improvement in living conditions will lead to improvements in the functioning of human beings, as for example the observation that average body size increased in industrialized countries with improved nutrition between 1900 and 2000. Of particular interest to colonial scientists is the supposed “Flynn Effect,” in that the measured intelligence quotient (IQ) increased generationally due to improvements in semantic and episodic memory arising from modern media, although others cite heterosis as a major factor instead. Social engineers in some colonies seized upon the theories of euthenics to promote projects they believed would improve the mental and/or physical attributes of the civil populations; among the most obvious are the automated infant-care centers known as “cr&egrave;ches” with every aspect – schedule, diet, sensory input, etc. – programmed to promote childhood development; staffed by robotic surrogates under the direction of a central AI, it is as yet uncertain as to the efficacy of euthenics in this form.</div>
