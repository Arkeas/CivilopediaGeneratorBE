		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Upon acquiring the Alien Biology technology, your Worker units and the Miasmic Repulsor orbital unit can remove miasma from tiles. To remove miasma with a Worker unit, it will have the option among its Actions to be ordered to “Clear Miasma.” The number of turns to remove the miasma is indicated when you hover the cursor over the order. Upon completion, the miasma is immediately removed from the map.<br /><br />The Miasmic Repulsor, once placed, will remove the miasma from hexes having it, starting in its placement hex and radiating outward.</div>
