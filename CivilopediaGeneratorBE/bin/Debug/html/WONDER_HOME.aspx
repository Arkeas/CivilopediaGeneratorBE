			Inevitably the various colonies on the new planet sought advantage over their rivals, and so committed their populace and production to the creation of one-of-a-kind wonders of various types after the basic necessities had been secured. Some opened new paths for the pursuit of knowledge; some promoted production, or wealth, or art; and some offered security in this dangerous world. These “Great Wonders” – whether imposing and massive constructs dominating the skyline for kilometers around, or small, unprepossessing structures housing unique marvels – became part of the social and cultural foundations of the colony that completed them.
