		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">As it has come to be understood since planetfall, planetary engineering encompasses but is more than mere terraforming, which generally looks to induce ecological change in a limited region or a minor adjustment globally. On the extreme edge of the capabilities of a Type I civilization on the Kardashev scale, planetary engineering may involve mega-engineering projects, major climatological change such as ocean iron fertilization or carbon sequestration, injection of stratospheric sulfate aerosols, placing solar mirrors at Lagrangian points, and other methods. Although some small-scale projects using existing methods have been undertaken, colonial technology and engineering is only now approaching a point where such efforts may be feasible. However, such projects would, in all likelihood, need to be multi-colonial, and given the divergent beliefs and goals of the various administrations it is unlikely that such major undertakings will occur in the near future.</div>
