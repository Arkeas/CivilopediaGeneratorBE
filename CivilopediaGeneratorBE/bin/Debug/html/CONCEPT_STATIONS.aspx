		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In Beyond Earth, Stations are laboratories, organizations, or complexes established by entities independent from any colony or Affinity. They exist to pursue one or more activities (themed to the major systems of the game), and are exploitable by colonies. They do not own territory on the map and are not “cities” capable of creating buildings, Workers, or tile improvements. They are without territory and do not participate in diplomacy; they have one particular role or interaction they can offer the player.</div>
