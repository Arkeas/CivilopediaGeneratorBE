		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">An Affinity – a guiding philosophy towards the evolution of humanity – may be developed by the player during the course of the game to distinguish the character of their colony. There are three Affinities: <span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span>, <span class="color_supremacy_affinity">Supremacy</span>, and <span class="color_purity_affinity">Purity</span>.<br /><br />Each player will probably end the game with some combination of these. Some players may choose to focus heavily on one particular Affinity, while others may spread across all three.</div>
