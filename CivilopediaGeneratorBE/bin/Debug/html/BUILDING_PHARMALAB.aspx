		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">With the development of the early transgenetic engineering, a number of procedures to create useful pharmaceuticals from plants in which exogenous genes had been inserted were created. In some cases, Terran fauna was modified with DNA structures from indigenous plants, and in some cases the reverse (such as the “super-fungoid” that produced a number of antivirals and fungicides that helped in treatment of miasmic poisoning). The genetic engineering and cultivation of transgenetic plants takes place in pharmalabs, most of which also conduct transgenetic research. The range of pharmaceuticals produced in colonial pharmalabs is impressive, covering virtually every medical procedure from contraception to euthanasia. In recent decades, pharmalab drugs have also become part of the research efforts to augment humans and create cybernetic organisms. But it is in the realm of the treatment of illness and injury that the contributions of pharmalabs have been most significant; without the modern pharmalab the settlement of this world would have been more hazardous and less rapid. Thus, pharmalabs have become a key component in the medical infrastructure of most colonial settlements.</div>
