		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Military researchers have discovered an interesting side effect of bipedalism (first noted by the Willuhn Military Institute): Soldiers fight better alongside a bipedal combat unit than a quadrupedal one. There are various explanations for the Willuhn Effect, but it is believed that the advantage provided to other human soldiers more than offsets the developmental costs of building a bipedal combat unit. Soldiers tend to think of these units as elevated proxies for humanity. A factorial analysis suggests the representation lies somewhere between “combat demigods” and “big brother with the big gun.” This has been taken further by certain military scientists and can best be seen in the Aegis.<br /><br />Unlike many Purity combat units, the Aegis does have a combat AI, although it is entirely devoted to maintaining posture, coordinating movement, repairing damage, and reloading weaponry, leaving the human operator free to focus on fighting the enemy. By design, the AI cannot initiate any but the most basic of movement (typically just walking in and out of the repair gantry) and may not trigger weapons. The human operator, on the other hand, is more than capable of using the myriad of weapons systems to confront a variety of battlefield threats. The great tactical value of the Aegis is that one human operator can confront many adversaries at a time, or turn all of the weapons of his Aegis against a single threat.<br /><br />The Aegis does not attempt to hide. It broadcasts its power in its posture and its weapons to friends and foes alike. Aegis pilots are highly-trained and highly-regarded by their fellow soldiers, because the Aegis is always willing to draw the enemy attention right before delivering a powerful attack to save his comrades, thus demonstrating the power of these titans who stalk the battlefields.</div>
