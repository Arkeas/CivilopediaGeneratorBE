		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">A unit gains experience points (XPs) for surviving a round of combat. The unit doesn’t have to win the combat or destroy the enemy to get the experience; it accrues each round that the unit lives through.<br />The amount of XPs the unit gets depends upon the circumstances of the combat. Generally, units get more XPs for attacking than defending, and more for engaging in melee combat than for other types. Here are some examples:<br />An Attacking Melee Unit: 5 XPs<br />Defending Against a Melee Attack: 4 XPs<br />An Attacking Ranged Unit: 2 XPs<br />Being Attacked by a Ranged Unit: 2 XPs<br />Alien Limitations: Once a unit has gotten 30 XPs, it no longer gets any additional XPs for fighting alien lifeforms.</div>
