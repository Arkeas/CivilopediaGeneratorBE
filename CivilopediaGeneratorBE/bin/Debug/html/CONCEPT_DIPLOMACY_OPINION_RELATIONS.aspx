		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Improve Relationship with Friendly Third-Party:<br />If a player has a Cooperation Agreement or Alliance with another and a third player establishes either of those with the second, a positive improvement in the attitude of the third towards the first will result. (In simpler terms, “the friend of my friend is my friend.”) The range of improvement is proportional both to the strength of the friendship between the first two and between the second two.<br /><br />Improve Relationship with a Hostile Third-Party:<br />If a player is hostile to (though not necessarily at war with) another, and a third party takes action to degrade their own relationship with the second, a positive improvement in the attitude of the third towards the first will result. In other words, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” As with the above, this is proportional to the strength of the level of hostility the second party has with both the others.<br /><br />Degrade Relationship with a Friendly Third-Party:<br />If a colony leader has a friendly diplomatic state with and/or opinion of you and a third party takes action to degrade their own relationship with the first colony, your relationship with that third party will degrade. The negative impact is proportional to the strength of friendship/degradation, respectively.<br /><br />Degrade Relationship with a Hostile Third-Party:<br />If you are Neutral or in Open War with another colony and a third establishes a friendly diplomatic state with your enemy, your relationship with the third will degrade. The range of negative impact is proportional both to the strength of the hostility between you and your enemy and the strength of the new friendliness between the other two.</div>
