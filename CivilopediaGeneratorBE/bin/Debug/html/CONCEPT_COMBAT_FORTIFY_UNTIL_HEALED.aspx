		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">If a unit is damaged, the “Fortify Until Healed” button -- or "Anchor Until Healed" for naval units -- appears in its Action buttons. If you click on this button, the unit will remain in its present location until it is fully healed.<br /><br />In the case of land units, they will Fortify during this time, increasing their defense against attacks. The amount of damage (hit points or HP) that a unit heals depends upon the unit’s location.<br />In a City: A unit heals 30 HPs per turn.<br />In Friendly Territory: 20 HPs per turn.<br />In Neutral or Enemy Territory: 10 HP per turn.<br /><br />Note that certain upgrades, buildings and improvements may accelerate a unit’s healing rate.</div>
