		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Naval military units include melee, ranged, submarine, and aircraft carrier units. They can be very powerful individually or in fleets, and composing and using a naval army demands just as much care and planning as a land army. <br /><br />There are also non-military naval units, suck as Workers and Colonists. These civilians serve the same role they do on land, and are vulnerable to attack or capture if caught in a war. “Embarked” Land Units are considered non-military units as well, and they are weak and easily destroyed when attacked by naval combat units.</div>
