		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The Combat Rover we know today finds its roots in terrestrial ATVs. These “all-terrain vehicles” were adapted into robotic rovers for the purpose of mapping Earth’s moon, the planet Mars, and other bodies located within the Sol system. When humanity eventually joined their robots on these foreign bodies, the rovers were modified to accommodate passengers. Then, the Great Mistake happened and our eyes turned away from the Heavens. As we moved into the time of the Seeding, it was only logical to adapt these vehicles for military use.<br /><br />Utilizing either four or six wheels, these off-world military vehicles can support various mounted-weapon systems, while also carrying troops over long distances of rough terrain. Tasked with scouting and raiding duties, these units began to operate in a manner similar to the motorized cavalry of post-WWII Earth, eventually earning the official distinction.<br /><br />The Combat Rovers, as they are now called, offer maneuverability, speed and firepower on a wide array of missions across this world’s trackless surface. Technological research into the use of native resources has made such units increasingly effective, to the point where motorized cavalry are the primary service branch in many colonial armed forces.</div>
