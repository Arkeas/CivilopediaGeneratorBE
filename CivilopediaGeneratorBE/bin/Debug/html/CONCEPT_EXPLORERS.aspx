		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">This planet is littered with expedition sites, the remains of earlier events that occurred before you arrived. These sites provide no benefit on their own, but will allow an Explorer unit to perform an Expedition action, which will provide a bonus. The Explorer loses one Expedition Module when the Expedition action is completed. Explorers have generally one Module, but this number can be increased, e.g. by adopting the Pathfinders Virtue in the Prosperity branch. Expedition Modules can be replenished by moving your Explorer back into one of your Cities.</div>
