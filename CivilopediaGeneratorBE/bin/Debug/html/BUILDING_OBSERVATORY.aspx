		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Among some of the first scientific installations constructed by the colonists were observatories, used not only for celestial mapping of their new Heavens but also for studies in meteorology, geology, oceanography and volcanology as they struggled to understand this new planet. Originally using a variety of devices to monitor the electromagnetic spectrum, the telescopes in the ground-based observatories eventually provided a composite map of the near- and far-space fields, as well as a complete track of the debris fields left in orbit from the several interstellar ships that brought humans here. Radio telescopes produced images from the heart of the galaxy far superior to those of any observatory on Old Earth, thanks to the somewhat thinner atmosphere of this world. X-ray, gamma-ray and high-energy particle telescopes were later incorporated into some colonial observatories; newer observatories now also include gravitational-wave detectors to locate and measure distortions of spacetime, and neutrino detectors used to map supernovas and other unique celestial phenomena. All of these observations are of great interest as some colonial administrations contemplate a return to space and reestablishing contact with the homeworld. Finally, the vital contributions to colonial expansion and security should be noted, which have been offered by the volcano observatories on this more geologically active planet.</div>
