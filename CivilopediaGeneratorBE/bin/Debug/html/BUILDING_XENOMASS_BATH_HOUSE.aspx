		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Bath houses have been part of life for people since ancient times, but this knowledge has only recently been rediscovered. The traditional bath house was a place of relaxation and cleansing. From the Roman bath to the Turkish hammam, people have enjoyed them for centuries. The Xenomass bath house is very similar to these traditional bath houses, but uses processed Xenomass instead of traditional hot water... with extraordinary results.</div>
