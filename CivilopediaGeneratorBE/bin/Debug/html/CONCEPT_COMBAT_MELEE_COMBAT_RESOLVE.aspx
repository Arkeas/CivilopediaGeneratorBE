		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">When two units engage in melee combat, the result is determined by the relative Combat Strengths of the two units – e.g., if a powerful unit fights a weak one, the powerful unit is likely to do more damage to its enemy, possibly destroying it altogether.<br />However many different factors may affect a unit’s strength in battle. A unit may receive “defensive bonuses” that will increase its melee strength when it is attacked while occupying forests or hills, or are fortified. Also, a unit’s damage may reduce its current Combat Strength.</div>
