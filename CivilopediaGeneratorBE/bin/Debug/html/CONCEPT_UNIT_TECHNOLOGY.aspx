		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">A Unit Type becomes available to build once its prerequisite Technology is researched. Based on this, Unit Types can be roughly divided into two categories. Generic Units are unlocked by researching technologies that are found relatively early in the game. The Technology and their Upgrades are not closely tied to any particular Affinity. Affinity Units, on the other hand, are unlocked by later Technologies. Both in their required Technology and in the structure of their Upgrades, they are strongly tied to one Affinity.</div>
