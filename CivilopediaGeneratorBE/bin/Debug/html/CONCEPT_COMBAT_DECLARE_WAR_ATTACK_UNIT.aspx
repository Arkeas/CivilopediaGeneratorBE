		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">You can simply order one of your units to attack another colony’s unit. If you’re not currently at war with the colony you’re attacking, a pop-up message will appear asking if you want to declare war on that player; if you choose to do so, the attack occurs and a war is underway. If you decline, the attack is aborted and you remain at peace.</div>
