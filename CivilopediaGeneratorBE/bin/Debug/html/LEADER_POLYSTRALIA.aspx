<h2>Early Life</h2><div class="infobox">Hutama came to public notice first as a 20-year-old college student at the Universitas Sumatera Utara in Medan, Indonesia, heading a grassroots movement protesting differential resources assigned to reclamation projects across the Commonwealth. But what differentiated Hutama was his incredible charm, media savvy, and drive. Ubiquitous on social networks and broadcast, Hutama's cheerful face, trilinguality, and informal quips endeared him to audiences across the Commonwealth. From Perth to Vanuatu, Hutama was instantly recognizable, parlaying this into a career in politics.</div>
<h2>Political Career</h2><div class="infobox">Elected to the Commonwealth Parliament before his 30th birthday as a junior member of the opposition, he famously launched the Platypus Inquiry, which ended up splitting the majority coalition, toppling that government and ushering in a new government with Hutama as Interior Minister. Once in high office, he continued his work against corruption, crony contracts, and waste, all while retaining his famous irreverent, informal sense of humor. His weekly Internet broadcast "Question, Minister" mixed populism, no small amount of flashy production, and occasionally serious politics. Hutama is credited with delivering the popular vote needed on a referendum on funding Polystralia's merchant fleet, on being an early backer of the Tahiti2 Island Project, and on universal access to fresh water.</div>
<h2>Politics</h2><div class="infobox">Hutama's "spread the wealth" populist politics were key to his success, but it would be wrong to assume that these were cynical ploys. His sharpest criticisms were always reserved to people exploiting the public well-being, and his own personal charities were devoted to alleviating suffering throughout the Commonwealth. Gadfly he might be on the screen, but this was motivated by a strong sense of public justice.</div>
<h2>Mission to Space</h2><div class="infobox">Notably, Hutama seems to have misread public attitudes about the Seeding. After publicly calling into question the Commission Report on the Inflection Point, he resisted Polystralia's efforts to strengthen its space program and start Seeding construction. After a series of sharp political defeats (and a decline in his weekly show ratings) Hutama reversed his position, although his support carried something of a satirical edge. But when the time came to nominate leaders, Hutama's loyalists across the Commonwealth put his name forward - even after Hutama devoted an entire program to reasons why he would be a bad expedition leader.</div>
