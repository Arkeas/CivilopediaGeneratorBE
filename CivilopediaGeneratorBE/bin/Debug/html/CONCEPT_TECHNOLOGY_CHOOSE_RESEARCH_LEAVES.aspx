		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Leaf techs cost significantly more science to research and are much more specific in scope than branch techs, but occur in much greater quantities. Leaves are clustered in groups around a branch tech and connect exclusively to that branch. Each leaf represents a specialization of the branch tech’s theme, unlocking specific items (buildings, units, wonders, actions) that relate to that specialization.</div>
