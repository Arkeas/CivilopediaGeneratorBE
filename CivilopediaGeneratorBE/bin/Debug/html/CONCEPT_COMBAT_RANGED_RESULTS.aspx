		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">At the end of ranged combat, the target unit may have sustained no damage, some damage, or it may have been destroyed. Remember that the attacking unit will never suffer any damage during ranged combat.<br /><br />If the target is destroyed, the attacking unit does not enter the now-vacant tile (as usually happens during melee combat), but you may send another unit into the empty space if you’ve got one with the movement points available that has not yet moved.</div>
