		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">On Old Earth at the time of the Seeding most people still thought of wealth and trade in traditional terms – money, precious minerals, land, luxuries and such. But when the colonists arrived on this planet, such meant little in their daily struggle to survive. What proved of exceptional value instead was the Energy, in all its forms, to power vehicles, shelters, equipment, laboratories, factories, satellites and all the other things necessary to tame this new frontier.<br /><br />Whether the electrical Energy stored in batteries and power packs, the chemical Energy of fuels and biomasses, the mechanical Energy of man-hours and simple machines, Energy became the currency of Mankind’s new home. Although on the private level a barter economy flourished, several colony administrators soon standardized an Energy conversion rate of exchange, based in large part on the electricity markets operating as reserves in Chile in the 1980s AD. Henceforth, wealth and trade took the form of Energy, stored and spent.</div>
