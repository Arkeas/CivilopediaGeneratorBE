		<h2>Game Info:</h2><div class="infobox">Trade Unit. Used to establish Trade Routes by land between your cities and other cities, outposts, or stations. Trade Routes generate yields or increased outpost growth rate for the trading partners, but trade units are vulnerable to attack and their routes must be protected by military units.</div>
		
		
		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Since the ancient days of camel caravans across the Qattara Depression and the Gobi Desert on Old Earth, trade vehicles have travelled in convoy. Both for security and logistic reasons, the most efficient and cost-effective means of moving goods and people across harsh lands to distant markets was for merchants to band together. Once the first colonial settlements were secure and there were Energy surpluses, ambitious individuals began opening trade routes to far cities and stations. While the form may change – with motorized transport rather than animal-drawn vehicles – the logic remains the same: to move wealth safely across a hostile environment to exchange for even greater wealth.</div>
