		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Diplomatic contact between colonies is established immediately after they both arrive on the planet. Once in contact with another political entity you can speak with them at any time - though they may not have much to say if they hate you.<br /><br />Note that another colony may attempt to open negotiations with you, as well, if they are interested in a diplomatic relationship with your colony.</div>
