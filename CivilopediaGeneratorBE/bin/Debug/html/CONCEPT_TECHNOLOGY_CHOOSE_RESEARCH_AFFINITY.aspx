		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In addition to providing the majority of the items, leaf techs are also the primary vector for awarding Affinity progression. Thus, when a player chooses to research a particular leaf instead of another, they are pursuing both that leaf tech’s items and the Affinity progress associated with it. This allows players to freely traverse the web along any branch without sacrificing the ability to pursue their preferred Affinity.</div>
