		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">By the end of the 21st Century, information was the new currency on Old Earth; the acquisition, analysis, sale and transmission of information was the primary business of Mankind, generating wealth, influence and control. Concurrently, advances in computing and research in cybernetics focused on data manipulation and transmission, making symmetrical networks ideal for reference storage, compartmentalized security and base-line computation. But the nuclear strikes, electromagnetic pulses and orbital cyber-attacks of the brief war had fried many networks, even those of non-combatants. In response post-Mistake corporations and governments built a network of redistribution nodes for distributed systems to insure that their information would never again be lost due to external disasters. Upon planetfall on this world, most colony commanders had plans to build similar distributed networks for commercial and reference purposes – although, due to the search for essential materials, it was years before the architecture of Old Earth systems could be replicated. Meanwhile, colonial cyberneticists had advanced their research, making node-based quantum networks linking the settlements of a colony far more efficient, with the potential for autonomous artificial intelligence. Most settlements, along with some inter-colonial private ventures, undertook to build node “banks” to serve as the backbone for these distributed systems. Node banks are now prevalent across the planet, moving encrypted data packets at the speed of light and easily distinguished in the settlement skylines by their expansive arrays of communication hardware.</div>
