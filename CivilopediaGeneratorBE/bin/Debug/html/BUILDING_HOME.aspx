			The building bricks of any culture are the structures that house, feed, guard, guide and enlighten its members. In new colonies, whether on Old Earth in the 1700s or this new world in the 2600s, these functions were even more important than in tamed lands. Constructed of various materials – initially prefab components and ship salvage, later from indigenous minerals and plants – in various styles for various purposes, the colonial buildings also offered important intangibles: a sense of accomplishment, national unity, and touch of home. Although over the decades since planetfall the buildings may have changed dramatically in appearance (along with the colonists), each still has its place in the modern settlements.
