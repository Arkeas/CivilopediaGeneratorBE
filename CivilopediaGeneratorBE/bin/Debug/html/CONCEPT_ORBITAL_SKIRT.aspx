		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">An orbital unit’s effect is applied to an area below it, called the effect area or “skirt.” For passive effects (say, a Food increase for tiles), this skirt is the area which receives the effect. For activated abilities (for example, a ground bombardment), this is the range where the ability may be used.<br /><br />Orbital units can have different skirt sizes. For instance, defensive military satellites may affect units within a radius of four hexes, while terraforming satellites being narrowly targeted have a radius of one hex.</div>
