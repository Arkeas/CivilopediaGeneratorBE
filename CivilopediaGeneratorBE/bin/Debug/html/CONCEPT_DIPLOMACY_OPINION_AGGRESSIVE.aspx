		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">There are several aggressive activities:<br /><br />Aggressive Military Deployment:<br />If you mass or “station” (fortify for 5+ turns) troops on or inside another colony’s borders, or if you deploy military or espionage satellites in positions that overlap another colony’s territory, the respect or fear between your colonies will degrade. This activity can provoke a confrontation.<br /><br />Aggressive Expansion:<br />If you establish outposts in positions that encroach on another’s territory, your respect will be negatively impacted. By default, an aggressive outpost is one whose working area (after city conversion) would touch the other colony’s borders. Each leader’s personality can modify his/her range of sensitivity to expansion activity. This activity can provoke a confrontation.<br /><br />Aggressive Covert Operations:<br />If you are caught engaging in harmful covert operations in another colony’s city, your respect will be negatively affected. The degradation is proportional to the severity of the operation, whether or not it succeeded, and whether the other colony has a track record of covert aggression against any colony (not just you). Aggressive covert operation types include: Siphoning Energy, Stealing Science, Stealing Technology, Recruiting Defectors, Dirty Bomb/Worm Strike/Hack (Affinity covert ops). This activity can provoke a confrontation.<br /><br />Aggression Towards Friendly Stations:<br />If you attack or destroy a Station that another colony was trading with, it will hurt the respect between the two colonies. The degradation strength is proportional to the Station’s level and the length of the trading history between the station and the other colony. This activity can provoke a confrontation.</div>
