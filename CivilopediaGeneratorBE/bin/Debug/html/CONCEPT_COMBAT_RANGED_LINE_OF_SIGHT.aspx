		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Generally, a ranged unit must be able to “see” its target in order to be able to fire at it. A unit cannot see a target if a blocking terrain type of feature is between the two – a mountain or hill, for example, or a tile with a forest. A unit can always see into a tile, even if it contains blocking terrain, but it cannot see objects in tiles past the blocking terrain.</div>
