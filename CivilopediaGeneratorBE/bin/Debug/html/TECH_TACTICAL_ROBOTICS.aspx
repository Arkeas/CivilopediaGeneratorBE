		<h2>Quote:</h2><div class="infobox">"It has been said, 'The point of war is not to die for your country, but to make your enemy die for theirs'; a goal which is more readily accomplished if your side never has to take the field."<br />- Rejinaldo Leonardo Pedro Bolivar de Alencar-Araripe, Principles of Modern War</div>
		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">An interdisciplinary field with elements of bionics, cybernetics and genetic engineering, research in military robotics has as its goal making robots that simulate biological lifeforms. Culmination would be the creation of autonomous androids, synthetic organisms indistinguishable from human soldiers but with enhanced senses, strength, speed, hardiness, intelligence and other attributes. While colonial scientists have not reached that goal, they have perfected cybernetic/bionic battle armor, one of the most advanced engineering constructs on this planet. Manufactured individually with a variety of configurations, armaments and sensor systems, colonial battlesuits do have some commonalities: a servomechanical exoskeleton, electroactive polymer outer coating, hybrid assistive limbs, a bounce comm system. Another path in biorobotic research has been in adaptive, non-humanoid military robots tasked to work in extreme field environments, including as a precursor to “unmanned” interstellar combat missions.</div>
