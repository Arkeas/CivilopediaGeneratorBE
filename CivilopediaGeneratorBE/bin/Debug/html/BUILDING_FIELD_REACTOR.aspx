		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">One of the unexpected attributes of the creation of a “quantum vacuum” is the containment of all forms of energy within the field, whatever form that energy might be: thermal, chemical, electrostatic, electric, magnetic, radiant, and nuclear being the most notable. Being relatively undifferentiated within the field, the law of energy conservation allowed all forms to be safely tapped and channeled for application to processes outside the field. The first apparatuses to create quantum vacuums designed by colonial engineers were massive constructs, immobile and labor-intensive during operation. In time, as research on field theories progressed and colonial manufacturing plants became more sophisticated in producing precision components, it became possible for smaller “field reactors” that could maintain the notoriously unstable quantum vacuums to produce energy of a preferred type, and were even convertible to simple kinetic or mechanical forms if needed. Within a small circumference field, the sum total of energy was enough to fulfill the needs of almost any colonial city. Meanwhile, monitoring and maintenance requirements were streamlined and simplified, to the point where most could be handled by quantum computers with feedforward analysis programs similar to those in autoplants. Settlements rushed to construct such reactors as soon as they had the technology in hand.</div>
