		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Once the potential of floatstone in mag-lev propulsion was appreciated, a “floatstone rush” erupted as prospectors – both private and colony-sponsored – sought to stake claim to the richest fields. Since the location of the monopolar “deposits” could be affected somewhat by wind currents and magnetic anomalies, the competition was fierce. Once a field was secured and could be worked, it was often the fact that a lev plant was built nearby for the production of mag-lev engines. Whether the engines were small for personal vehicles or intended for construction or military equipment, the principle was the same: the machined monopole floatstone was “excited” by an electromagnetic field and produced magnetic repulsion of a magnitude far beyond that possible with a bipolar magnet. Since the process generated significant amounts of waste heat, the engine must be cooled by liquid nitrogen systems. The lev plants incorporated the latest developments in automated and robotic assembly line production, quantum programming, and speed-and-feed cybernetics. Most lev plants operate under the Six Sigma theory for manufacturing developed on Old Earth during the 1980s, which minimize variability through a defined sequence of quality assurance checks with a quantified value target – minimum average acceptable by colonial standards is 2.6 defective parts per million units. The movement to Sigma Six operations has made mag-lev vehicles the most reliable and common transportation in most colonies.</div>
