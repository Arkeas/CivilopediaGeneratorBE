		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">When an Affinity becomes dominant for a colony, its basic military units will upgrade to an Affinity-related type. For instance, the basic Soldier unit will be replaced by a Brawler unit for a <span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span> player, by a Sentinel unit for <span class="color_purity_affinity">Purity</span>, and by a Disciple unit if <span class="color_supremacy_affinity">Supremacy</span>. With higher Affinity levels come ever greater unit upgrades.</div>
