		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The concept of cavalry is ancient: A soldier with higher mobility than conventional infantry. The exact source of this mobility has changed over time: First horses, then internal-combustion ground vehicles, then internal-combustion aircraft, then back to vehicles (and even horses before their extinction) during the time of the Great Mistake. Military scientists have identified the exact relationship of mount cost and mount mobility that predicts the kind of mount soldiers will use.<br /><br />It became apparent early on to these military scientists that xenoforms would be used fairly early in colonial history. What living creatures offer is not raw speed, but an unparalleled terrain-crossing ability. Legs often go where wheels fear to tread. The Raptor Bug proved an excellent platform for breeding as a cavalry mount. Like a horse, it possesses enough cognitive capacity to follow human direction and operate semi-independently when trained well. The Raptor Bug's adrenocortical responses have a low degree of self-preservation once they have reproduced, which makes them fearless. And their load capacity is relatively high for their slender build. Research breeding and design programs quickly settled on the "Cavalgada White" strain, which is the mother-strain of all current Xeno Cavalry mounts.<br /><br />It is curious that across ages and mounts, cavalry soldiers quickly converge on a type: Risk-seeking, speed-loving, gregarious, and flamboyant. The Xeno Cavalry was no exception. They clamored for archaic weapons such as sabers and lances as vital military hardware. Uniforms became ornate beyond the needs of field recognition. And the raid became their favorite strategic operation - quick strikes at poorly protected targets in rear areas. The Xeno Cavalry would emerge, their warcries strangely distorted and amplified by unapproved modifications to their armor and helmets, joined by the ululation of their mounts.</div>
