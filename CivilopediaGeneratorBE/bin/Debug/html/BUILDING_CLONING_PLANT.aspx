		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">On Old Earth between 1963 AD and the Seeding, scientists had successfully cloned over six dozen animal species ranging from carp to monkeys; in 1998 the first hybrid human clone was created using human DNA and a cow’s egg, followed in 2008 with the first successful creation of several mature human embryos using human skin DNA. By the Seeding, a number of cloning plants were mass producing embryos of livestock and endangered species. The equipment necessary for such was included in the cargo of some colony ships, and animal cloning plants were soon constructed on this planet. For many decades, most colonial settlements resisted the cloning of humans or human-hybrids, in some cases for ethical or religious reasons and in others economic and political. However, cloning technology progressed rapidly even as the movements towards modified humans took hold in some colonies. Somatic cell nuclear transfer meant that transhumans and adaptive humans could be reproduced in quantity. The continuous struggle to tame this world, and the growing conflicts between expanding colonies, put a premium on ever larger militaries. Since the birth rate in many settlements remained low, yet colony leaders still wished to claim new territories, a number of administrations built cloning plants to supplement their recruiting base through the mass creation of new types of soldiers that could be brought to maturity in short periods of time.</div>
