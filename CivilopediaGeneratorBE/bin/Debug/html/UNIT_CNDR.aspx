		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">One of the axioms of military operations is that it takes a far smaller force to defend than to attack. The defender understands the position over which she is fighting and is better able to deploy her resources efficiently. Indeed, even the simplest military AI system can usually prepare an efficient defense  given only minimal time or information. But when the defensive area is well understood, and a robust military AI is given direct control of battlefield units, that defense can be very efficient indeed.<br /><br />Thus, the Cognitive Neuroelectronic Defense Registry was created to be a system of networked combat frames and controlling AI arrays. Hugely redundant and built with a considerable degree of modularity (such as the AI nodules and the combat frame kinesthetic cortices using the same black boxes), CNDR was foremost a defensive unit that could observe, report, adapt to and counter a military threat. Since home territory could be surveyed at leisure, the AI system had ample opportunity to wargame and simulate incoming threats. Keeping CNDR as a reserve and protective force meant faster repair and turnaround on damaged combat frames. But best of all, this freed up human forces for offensive, out-of-territory operations where human ingenuity and tactical flexibility was still more effective than drone combat systems.<br /><br />The ubiquity of CNDR hardware meant that it eventually became a de facto standard for robotic applications long after CNDR was discontinued. If you have ever wondered why Category 2 bipedal robot frames have only 34 channels for locomotor-haptic feedback, it is because that is a holdover from the old CNDR combat frame standard.</div>
