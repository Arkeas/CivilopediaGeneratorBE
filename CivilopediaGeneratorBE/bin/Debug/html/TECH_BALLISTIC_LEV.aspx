		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Advances in mag-lev ballistics brought about research into the potential for moving payloads from the surface of this planet into low orbit. Initial designs focused on creating a “ballistic loop,” an active mag-lev cable transport system approximately 1000 km in length and maintained at an altitude of 80 km. Rather than other forms of propulsion, massive mag-lev engines would lift the payload compartment away from the track while simultaneously applying a hyper-ballistic 3g acceleration until it reaches orbital velocity (roughly a delta-v of 1.6 km/s2) and the compartment would leave the track. With a 500 megawatt power station, such an installation would be capable of up to 35 launches a day, making ballistic lev both affordable and productive far beyond any other method of reaching orbit. Smaller versions are currently under construction, with some colonies investigating the engineering of a full-scale ballistic lev launch loop facility.</div>
