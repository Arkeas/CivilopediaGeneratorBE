		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">This is the special victory for <span class="color_purity_affinity">Purity</span>. In this victory, the player constructs a Warp Gate (called the Exodus Gate) and brings the population of the dying Earth through to the planet to settle it as their new home – their promised land.<br /><br />Steps to Promised Land:<br />There are four steps to a Promised Land Victory: contacting Earth, constructing the Exodus Gate, summoning Earthling Settlers with the Exodus Gate, and sheltering the Earthling Settlers.<br /><br />The only way to re-establish contact with Earth is to launch a Lasercom Satellite Orbital Unit.<br /><br />The Exodus Gate is a Planetary Wonder. After Earth is contacted, the player may build the Exodus Gate in any City.<br /><br />Once the Exodus Gate Wonder is complete, the player may activate it once per turn to produce an Earthling Settler unit. These are special civilian units that represent citizens of Earth that need to be relocated on the planet. The player does this by settling them into Earthling Settlements.<br /><br />Earthling Settlements are special improvements. They can be established anywhere on the planet’s surface, regardless of which colony controls the territory.<br /><br />Once an Earthling Settlement has been established, new Earthling Settlers can be added to it up to a maximum of 6. Every Earthling Settler established in a Settlement counts towards the victory progress score as soon as it is settled.<br /><br />Earthling Settlements have no combat abilities and are instantly destroyed when pillaged by a hostile unit. If an Earthling Settlement is destroyed, the Earthling citizens are lost and their population is deducted from the victory progress score. The settlement is replaced with ruins and the conquering player gains resources for the destruction.<br /><br />To complete the victory, the player must safely settle a certain number of Earthlings. If the Exodus Gate is destroyed, you do not lose progress towards the victory but must construct another Gate to continue.</div>
