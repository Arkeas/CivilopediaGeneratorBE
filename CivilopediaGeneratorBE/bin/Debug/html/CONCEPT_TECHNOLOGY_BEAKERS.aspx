		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Beakers come from your citizens (the population of your cities). Each turn you get a base number of beakers equal to the combined population of all of your cities. The larger your cities, the more beakers you generate.<br /><br />In addition to the beakers generated by your base population, you get 3 beakers from your core city. (Once you build your first city you'll generate 4 beakers each turn: 1 from your single citizen and 3 from the core city). You can earn additional beakers by constructing certain buildings or wonders, and by adopting certain Virtues.</div>
