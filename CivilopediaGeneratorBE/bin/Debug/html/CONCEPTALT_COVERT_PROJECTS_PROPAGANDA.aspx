		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Political will is a powerful predictor of a faction’s future political direction. The process of shaping the will of an opponent is a time-honored part of the intelligence trade, and continues to undergo change after planetfall. Propaganda projects involve recognizing and exploiting political schisms, shaping attitudes towards events and factions, and even elements of marketing and public relations. An agency which adopts propaganda as a priority can use an enemy faction’s population against their political masters.</div>
