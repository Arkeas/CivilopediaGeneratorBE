		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Custom quests are designed to provide players with narrative flavor for their domestic activities: territory expansion, city growth, buildings, wonders, and improvements. Each is intended to be fairly straightforward with one or two choices that allow the player to express a preference or a perspective on their recent activities and guide the development of their homeland in thematic and substantive ways, typically along Affinity lines.</div>
