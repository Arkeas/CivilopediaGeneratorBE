		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The <span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span> Affinity is themed around an understanding and integration with the planet’s alien ecology. Players who emphasize the <span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span> path will transform their colonists via genetic manipulation to be more adapted to the planet’s alien environment.<br /><br /><span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span> units and buildings feature organic components and naturally derived composite materials. Late-game <span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span> colonies can produce their own genetically modified versions of the planet’s native alien life, and adopt some of their aesthetics.</div>
