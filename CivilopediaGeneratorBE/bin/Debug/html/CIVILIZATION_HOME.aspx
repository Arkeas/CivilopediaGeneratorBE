			"The value of a contact is proportional to the number of people she can influence within the organization. Don’t negotiate with someone who can’t make things happen on their side."<br />- Suzanne Marjorie Fielding, Transplanetary Management, Methods, and Resources

			As has happened many times before in human history, a disaster – in this case a man-made one, the Great Mistake – reorganized the geo-political landscape of Old Earth. In the aftermath of the Great Mistake and the climate changes it wrought, once powerful nations declined in influence or changed course. Other nation-states that had been on the rise accelerated their evolution into major players on the world stage. And, in a couple of cases, entirely new entities rose to prominence. With the advent of the Inception Point, some of the Earth’s political and economic leaders would sponsor efforts to colonize other planets in what would come to be referred to as “The Seeding” by historians and laymen. It was, so they believed, Mankind’s last, great hope to create a better world.<br /><br />Each of these sponsors would dispatch multiple missions to give them the greatest chance of seeding those distant worlds and increasing humanity’s hopes of survival in the universe. But for the first, they had to find a mission leader among their best and brightest. However chosen, on the shoulders of these men and women would rest the fate of those distant, isolated settlements. Facing unknown dangers, responsible for thousands of colonists, charged with taming a hostile environment, the experience and character were critical to taking Mankind “Beyond Earth”.
