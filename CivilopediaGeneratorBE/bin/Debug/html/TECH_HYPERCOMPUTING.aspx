		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The Church-Turing thesis states that any operation that is algorithmically compatible can be solved by a Turing computer; “hypercomputing” refers to models that are incompatible with Turing computation, involving non-Turing functions, primarily through the use of super-recursive algorithms. Hypercomputation was first introduced in 1999 AD on Old Earth, and has become a highly specialized pursuit in computer engineering since planetfall. The first functioning hypercore computer on this planet was built only a generation ago; using “fuzzy logic,” it was capable of having an oracle or advice function embedded in a polynomial-sized Boolean circuit; thus, in effect, this hypercomputer could “predict” the future with extreme accuracy, so long as the terms of input and output were rigidly defined. A number of hypercore computers – each more sophisticated than this model – are currently under construction in several colonial settlements.</div>
