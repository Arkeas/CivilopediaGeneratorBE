		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">When your Health is extremely negative, you face a serious problem. Cities and Outposts will not grow as well, and may even stop growing altogether. Cities will have less Culture, Science, and Production. Covert Operations by rival leaders will also produce more intrigue, making your Cities more vulnerable.<br /><br />Remember that negative Health is not permanent. You can always increase your citizens’ Health – no matter how sick they may be – through the methods outlined above.</div>
