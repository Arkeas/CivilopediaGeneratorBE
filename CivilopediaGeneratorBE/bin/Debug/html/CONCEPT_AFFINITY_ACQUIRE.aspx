		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Some technologies have an Affinity associated with them. Researching these is the primary method for progressing a player’s Affinities. The more difficult the technology is to research, the greater the resulting Affinity progress. Thus, for instance, researching Genetic Mapping will move you a bit along the path towards <span class="color_purity_affinity">Purity</span>, while attaining Metamaterials gives you significant progress towards <span class="color_harmony_affinity">Harmony</span>.<br /><br />Progress is also possible through other means, such as Virtues and Expeditions.<br /><br />Once enough progress is made in an Affinity, it will advance to a higher level. Higher levels of Affinity require more effort to acquire, especially for an Affinity that is not already the player’s dominant one.</div>
