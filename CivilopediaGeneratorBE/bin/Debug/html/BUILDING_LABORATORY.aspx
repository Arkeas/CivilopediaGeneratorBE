		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">It was obvious that research and understanding would be a key to colonial survival and success, so creation of laboratories devoted to the many scientific disciplines necessary for settling an alien world was a priority for colonial administrators. While research in the traditional sciences such as chemistry, biology, geology and meteorology sought to understand and harness the wonders of the planet, new sciences arose from that understanding. Clinical investigation into unknown resources, flora and fauna conducted in colonial labs has brought technological and biological advances in a wide range of fields. With prototypes or designs of the latest research equipment at the time of launch, the colonial labs were models of efficiency as well as efficacy. To the already immense scientific databases were added thousands of inventions, insights, applications and discoveries to promote colonial expansion and exploitation across this new world. Although the hard-won knowledge was not always beneficial – some developments had unintended and unfortunate consequences – nevertheless the search continues unabated in laboratories across the planet.</div>
