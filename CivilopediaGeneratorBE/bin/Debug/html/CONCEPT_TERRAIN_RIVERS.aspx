		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Traditionally, cities have been built along rivers, and for good reason. Rivers provide irrigation, improving the farmland around the city, and they serve to protect a city, as it is difficult to mount an assault against a city across a river.<br /><br />Unlike other features, rivers run along the sides of the tiles rather than through them, so rivers provide their benefits to all tiles/units adjacent to them.<br /><br />City Yield: +1 Energy to adjacent tiles.<br />Movement Cost: Crossing consumes all remaining movement points unless a bridge is present.<br />Combat Modifier: 20% penalty when attacking across a river.</div>
