		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The Headquarters (a combination of building and wonder) is the seat of government for your colony. If your original capital has been captured, another city of yours will automatically be assigned as a replacement capital. Your Headquarters will be transferred automatically and this city functions in all ways like the original, except that it can be destroyed, and it does not count towards a Domination victory.</div>
