		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Having unraveled the “alien” genetic codes of most of the indigenous species, colonial scientists became intrigued by how the native flora and fauna had co-evolved in such an environment. The divergent evolutionary path exhibited by these species opened new lines of inquiry and discovery, leading to insights into biased mutation (molecular-level evolution), gene flow (the exchange of genes between species) and genetic assimilation (phenotype encoding). Researchers in many disciplines have explored the potential of these findings, seemingly associated with the mutational properties of xenomass. Although advances in understanding alien evolution on this planet are largely theoretical, some practical applications – such as the co-called “xenonurseries” established by some settlements – have resulted as well.</div>
