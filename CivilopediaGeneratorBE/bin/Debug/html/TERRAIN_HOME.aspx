			Geologists date this planet as much younger than Earth, it being approximately 3.92 billion years since formation (by contrast, Earth is 4.54 billion years); in evolutionary terms, it corresponds roughly to the Carboniferous Era, marked by invertebrates, heterosporous vegetation (mostly polypodiales, with some primitive angiosperms), and gigantism. Ecological diversity appears to be less pronounced than on Earth, however, with a number of niches filled by a single dominant species.<br /><br />Not so the terrain, which varies in form and type as dramatically as does the topography of Old Earth. This is a landscape cut by deep canyons, rolling hills and towering mountains. In places, primeval forests and miasmic marshes challenge the fortitude and perseverance of the settlers. Ice and snow make parts of this planet virtually uninhabitable, save to the hardiest explorers. But, for better or worse, this is the world that has been chosen to be Mankind’s new home – or at least one of them – and colonial leaders must adapt to the terrain.</div><h2>Features</h2><div class="infobox">Features are elements of terrain or vegetation that appear in a hex, atop the hex's terrain. (A grassland hex might have forest or marsh on it as well, for example.) Features modify a hex's productivity and might also alter the amount of "movement points" (MP) a unit expends when entering the hex. Features may also provide defensive combat bonuses or penalties to a unit occupying the hex.
