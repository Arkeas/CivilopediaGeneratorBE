<h2>Legend</h2><div class="infobox">Although western scholars are almost uniformly incredulous, the followers of Kavitha Thakur hold fast to the claim that she was born on the first day of June, 17 years before the events of the Great Mistake, making her well over 200 years old. More reliable estimates concede she may be considerably older than the average life expectancy.</div>
<h2>Early Life</h2><div class="infobox">As the daughter of revered northern mystic Raj Thakur, Kavitha had a strong spiritual connection at a young age. She often experienced near-catatonic states of “disembodied concentration,” during which she was said to have had visions of the far future. To the devotees of her father, this only served to solidify their belief that she would one day supplant him in his role, as he himself had declared upon her birth.</div>
<h2>Rise to Fame</h2><div class="infobox">Nearly 80 years after Raj Thakur's journey to the Kush, Kavitha’s followers numbered in the hundreds of millions as the stories of her and her father become legend among desperate and forgotten peoples.  Despite a number of political and military candidates tailored for the position, when it came time to elect a leader for the now geographically diverse region under their control, none saw a means to overcome Kavitha’s popularity.  Swept up in a nearly uncontested vote and thrust into a position of political authority she neither desired nor prepared for, Kavitha focused her early efforts on what she knew best – humanitarian campaigns. She focused her vast resources on repairing the damage done by her predecessors to the people of the Indian subcontinent.</div>
