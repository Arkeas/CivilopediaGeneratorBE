		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The Ranger is a Soldier trained in the use of long-range, portable artillery. Unlike mortars, rocket launchers, or other “light-weight” ordnance from the 20th Century, our modern artillery cannot be used by just any soldier. Specifically designed for use in outer space and on other worlds, these ranged weapons require precise calibration. As such, Rangers must possess an expert knowledge of Physics, Geometry, and other such sciences. This, coupled with their intense physical training, has earned them the nickname, “Geek Jocks.”<br /><br />Notable among their arsenal are directed-energy weapons (DEW), which use aimed energy to attack an enemy or fortification. The result of this attack can range from non-lethal to lethal, depending on the energy used. When first introduced, DEWs were capable of firing microwave, laser, particle-beam, and even sonic attacks.<br /><br />Rangers are also known for their magnetic weapons. Among their numbers are counted Ion Cannons, Coilguns, and Plasma Cannons. Usually reserved for heavier targets, the magnetic weapons have earned an infamous reputation for the damage they can inflict from a great distance.<br /><br />Since the founding of the colonies, research on both types of ordnance has continued. Not only have these weapons grown more lethal against alien species, but also more versatile in geo-engineering. Indeed, colonial mining and terraforming operations make extensive use of their capabilities, giving new meaning to the proverb “turning swords into ploughshares.”</div>
