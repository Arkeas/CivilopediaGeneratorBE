		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">There are two types of Wonders in Beyond Earth: Great Wonders and Planetary Wonders. Only one of each Great Wonder may be constructed anywhere in the world: once one colony has constructed one, no other player may do so. Wonders will disappear from the City Build Menu once you can no longer construct them.<br /><br />If another colony completes construction of a Great Wonder while you are building it, you will receive an Energy bonus as compensation, and you’ll have to begin construction on something else.</div>
