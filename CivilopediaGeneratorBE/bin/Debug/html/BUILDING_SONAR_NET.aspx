		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Building on the hydroacoustic echo location processes and technologies of 20th and 21st century of Sound Navigation and Ranging, or Sonar, the Sonar Net is the natural evolution of the Sound Surveillance System and Integrated Undersea Surveillance System. With various “rings” of passive and active sonobuoy fields, the multiple layers of the Sonar Net greatly enhances any aquatic based defensive measures or reconnaissance. The Sonar Net functions as a water-based version of a SAGE defensive perimeter.<br /><br />Operated multistatically, the Sonar Net was first introduced in military operations throughout the growing Pacific Ocean, preceding, and some claim precipitating, the Great Mistake. As NSA’s ARKs came online and rose (along with sea levels) in popularity, the prevalence of Sonar Nets became standard issue aquatic environments for all marine-based cities. Although only a “net” in an analogical sense, the Sonar Net is proven unparalleled performance prediction. Besides advanced signal processing and imaging capabilities, the Sonar Net employs advanced transponders to relay information immediately to defense operations by default. As climate change dramatically influenced oceanic conditions, Sonar Nets were retrofitted with modular Target Motion Analysis capabilities, to compensate for degraded signal clarity. The powerful infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies emitted by Sonar Fields, while minimally damaging to the little remaining lifeforms of Earth’s oceans, are known to disrupt alien lifeforms on colonial planets.</div>
