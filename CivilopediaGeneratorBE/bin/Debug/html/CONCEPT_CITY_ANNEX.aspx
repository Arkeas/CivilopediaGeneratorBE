		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">If you annex the city, you make it a part of your lands. You have control over the city, just as if you had constructed the city yourself. The downside to annexation is that doing so makes your colony less healthy, and you will be required to construct health-related buildings  (e.g. Pharmalab) or Wonders (e.g., Promethean) or connect to basic resources to counteract this decrease in overall health. Annexing too many cities too rapidly can bring about problems.</div>
