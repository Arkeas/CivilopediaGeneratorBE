<h2>Early Life</h2><div class="infobox">Suzanne Fielding was the eldest of three siblings, all daughters, born on the Texas Gulf Coast to a Mexican-born mother and an African-American father. Her father was the owner of three hardware stores in the region; Suzanne joined her father in running the business as a teenager. Accepting a scholarship to Louisiana State University, she graduated with honors and a double-major in economics and accounting. Driven by a desire to help reclaim coastal lands lost to the rising sea level in her home states, she was hired by the relatively new American Reclamation Corporation (ARC) to an entry-level position. Both meticulous and daring, and surprisingly adept at corporate politics, Fielding rose steadily through the ARC accounting division until, within 15 years, she was heading several operations simultaneously as operations manager.</div>
<h2>Career</h2><div class="infobox">When ARC CEO Michael Moderski signed the Trans-Mississippi Recovery Initiative, he personally asked Fielding to oversee the governmental resource coordination, to which she turned her considerable acumen. It was Fielding who caught the accounting chicanery which led to the FBI's Operation Riverboat and subsequent political fallout. Guiding the government to continue funding during the roiling controversy that followed, Fielding also kept the Initiative on track and on time, such that when Modersky stepped down as CEO, Fielding (who had since been elevated to CFO) was the logical choice for CEO. Sidestepping the Board of Directors, Fielding's appeal to the shareholders enabled her to hold both the CEO and CFO positions for ARC, making her the most powerful woman in the most powerful corporation in the world.</div>
<h2>Founding the Colony</h2><div class="infobox">With Fielding at the helm, ARC turned from retail and manufacturing to financial and other services. She used the balance sheet and financial weight of ARC as a massive lever, engineering a series of shifts on Old Wall Street to unseat banks and exchanges. As ARC's capital reserves blossomed, many wondered what Fielding would do next. Few expected that she would announce ARC pursuing its own private Seeding venture, drawing on its vast engineering and manufacturing resources, and gaining a waiver from the government to conduct private space operations. The biggest surprise was when Fielding announced she would personally lead the first such expedition. With enough money to buy the world, the woman who led ARC found more meaning in starting over with a new planet.</div>
