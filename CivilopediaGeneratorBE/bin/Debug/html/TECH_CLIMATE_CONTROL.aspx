		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">While climate control on Old Earth became a topic of great interest in the climatological chaos that followed the Great Mistake, little practical research was accomplished. However, after several generations had passed in Mankind’s tenure on this world, a number of colonial scientists turned their attention to the possibilities of inducing limited weather change in small areas. Although methods for inducing troposphere- and stratosphere-level changes had been long understood, the technology required did not exist. But small-scale methods – such as cool roofing, cloud reflectivity enhancement, cloud seeding, bio-precipitation, high-albedo crops and foehn arrays – could be used to affect temperature, atmospheric moisture, wind velocities and the like over geographically contained regions. Through combinations of such projects, colonies have been able to convert some areas from desert, swamp and tundra to more amenable terrain types.</div>
