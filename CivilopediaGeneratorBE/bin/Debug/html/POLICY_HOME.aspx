			When Mankind left Old Earth to make its way among the stars, it took the best and worst qualities of humanity along. Many, though, saw the new worlds as places where new virtues could be forged, altering our perceptions and abilities. In some cases, the so-called “colonial virtues” were consciously fostered by colonial administrations; in others, these seeming naturally evolved in response to the new environment. Whatever the root, these qualities defined the identities of the various colonies as surely as their ideologies, economies or technologies.<br /><br />There were no “right” or “wrong” choices when it came to adopting these virtues. Rather, these were generally pragmatic responses to practical problems. The combinations of colonial virtues are near infinite, and each combination gave the colonial leaders ever more chances to survive and thrive on this alien planet.
