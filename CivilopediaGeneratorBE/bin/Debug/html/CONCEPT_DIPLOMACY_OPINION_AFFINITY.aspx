		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The strongest positive influence is to share Affinity devotion. This only applies after both players have established a dominant Affinity (i.e. one Affinity at or above Level 3). As long as the two maintain that dominance, there is a steady positive influence to their relationship.<br /><br />A mismatch in dominant Affinity will be a permanent negative influence on relations, proportional to the strength of the devotion on both sides. However, unlike the positive counterpart, Affinity collision does not produce a persistent negative force on its own. Instead, it amplifies the downward force of any other negative action.</div>
