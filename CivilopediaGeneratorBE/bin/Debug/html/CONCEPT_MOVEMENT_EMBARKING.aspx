		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Land units can “embark” in order to enter and travel across water terrain. To embark a unit, simply order the unit to move onto a water tile. The unit will travel to the coast and then transition into an embarked form to enter the water.<br /><br />While embarked, land units are especially vulnerable. They are not able to attack, pillage, or capture aquatic cities, and they have greatly reduced defense against enemy attacks.</div>
