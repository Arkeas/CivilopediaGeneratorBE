		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">A player progresses in each Affinity through an experience point system. As certain Technologies are researched, experience points are added towards Affinities, and each Affinity will advance depending on the points. This progression gives gameplay benefits, primarily in the form of Unit Upgrades. The Affinity may open certain potential Victory Conditions. It also determines the aesthetics displayed for the player’s leader, cities and units.</div>
