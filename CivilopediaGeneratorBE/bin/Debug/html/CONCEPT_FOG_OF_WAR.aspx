		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The fog of war is represented by a black background overlaid with a faint hex grid that covers much of the world at the start of the game. As you move units around, the fog of war will pull back, revealing more of the world. Once you have cleared the fog of war from a tile, it doesn’t come back. However, if a unit moves and you can no longer see a tile, you won’t know what may be going on there.</div>
