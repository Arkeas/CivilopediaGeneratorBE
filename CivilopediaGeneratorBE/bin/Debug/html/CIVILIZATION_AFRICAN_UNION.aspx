<h2>A Continent Divided</h2><div class="infobox">Although untouched by the consequences of the Great Mistake, the African continent suffered from the migration of those fleeing their homes. As the seas rose, more refugees retreated from North Africa and coastal African nations. The humanitarian disaster shattered the fragile economies of many of the African nations, and destabilized regimes across the region. A generation-long cycle of coups and short-lived dictatorships, as well as an epidemic of border wars, tore Africa apart. While much of North Africa would eventually join the Franco-Iberian European Union, alleviating some of the pressure, the sub-Saharan nations struggled to return to order.</div>
<h2>Forged in Crisis</h2><div class="infobox">Into that breach stepped the leaders of the old African Union and COMESA (the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa). Both organizations had been established for decades and were regarded highly among Africans. Drawing on its original charter, members of the old African Union sought to provide political and military stability by invoking heretofore ignored supranational powers. Led by some of the original COMESA founding states, the revamped “People’s” African Union was formed. Several of the more progressive other African nations quickly joined; then more stable republics of sub-Saharan Africa followed. Others states, however, were governed by dictators or torn by civil wars, and refused.</div>
<h2>A New Union</h2><div class="infobox">The largest members of the new People’s African Union merged their military forces into a unified command and stepped in to end the unrest and political disruption, replacing the old despots with new regimes that promptly joined the Union. Even as that task continued, the military moved against local bandits, pirates, warlords, and others that threatened all citizens of the envisioned united Africa. New military traditions arose, and a new sense of pride was instilled into the pursuit of a military career. A number of grateful member states of the African Union elected or appointed military officers as their leaders.</div>
<h2>Recovery</h2><div class="infobox">Meanwhile, COMESA – propelled by its ties to the old and new African unions – moved to bring economic stability and prosperity to the continent. Instituting a unified currency was the first step; demolishing the tariff and taxation schemes of the various member states as they were added was another. COMESA involvement in the new Africa eventually turned to tapping its prodigious natural and agricultural resources, while attempting to maintain its ecological diversity and heritage through extensive wildlife parks and natural wonders. Funded projects included dams, new energy sources such as wind-farms, and coastal and Congolese reclamation efforts. The African Common Market also invested heavily in education for the post-Mistake generations and in humanitarian projects, notably in the realms of health care and human rights. New industries were pursued, and the Union became one of the major players in international trade. But problems remain, although the People’s African Union continues to implement policies to address these. Notable are the remnants of nepotism and corruption that plague some of the member nations, and the occasional flare-ups of tribal and/or religious conflict.</div>
<h2>Outward Bound</h2><div class="infobox">As with many things in the Union, the merchants and traders took the leading role when the Seeding began. Most of the missions launched were led and populated by prominent regional businessmen and respected civil servants. Although the governance and characteristics of the dozens of colonies would take many forms, all had their roots deep in African history and culture. While it may be facile to claim that it takes a village to raise a child, it may be said with certainty that it takes a village to survive as a colony on a distant world. The attitude of the African colonial administration is best summed up by the unofficial motto of the People’s African Union, the ancient Bondei proverb that says, “Sticks in a bundle are unbreakable.”</div>
