		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">In the late stages of Old Earth’s “Cold War,” various nations developed so-called “semi-automated ground environments” (SAGE) composed of networked computers and defense systems (largely missile-based) to serve as a unified defensive grid. Advances in computing and weaponry made these systems increasingly reactive and lethal, and eventually incorporated even production and storage of autonomous weapon platforms. It was inevitably, no matter how some decried it, that such defense perimeters would be recreated by colonial administrations. The most elaborate and efficient of these incorporated terrain barriers, particle and beam weapons directed by orbital platforms, and robotic AFVs, although all stopped short of utilizing WMDs or “planet-killers.”</div>
