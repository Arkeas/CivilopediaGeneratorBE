		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Land cities gain territory naturally through the growth of <img src="/civilopediabe/images/culture.png" alt="culture" /> Culture. As a land city gains Culture, it will acquire additional tiles in the surrounding unclaimed territory. The faster it gains Culture, the faster its territory will grow. Each city acquires territory depending upon its own cultural output. When it reaches a certain level, it will “claim” a new tile (if any are available). The amount of Culture required to get a new tile increases as the city’s territory grows.<br /><br />Aquatic cities do not gain territory through <img src="/civilopediabe/images/culture.png" alt="culture" /> Culture. Instead, they must move to new locations to claim the adjacent plots, adding these to the territory they have already acquired.<br /><br />If you do not want to wait for Culture to claim a tile, or you do not wish to move your aquatic city to claim new tiles, you can instead purchase tiles with Energy in the City screen. Any tile adjacent to your existing territory and within 3 tiles of the city itself can be bought with Energy.</div>
