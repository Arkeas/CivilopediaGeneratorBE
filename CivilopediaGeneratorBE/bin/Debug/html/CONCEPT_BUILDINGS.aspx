		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">When your unit enters an enemy city, you have three choices: you can raze the city, you can annex it and make it part of your colony, or you can make it into a puppet city. Each has its own benefits and costs.<br /><br />If a city is captured, its buildings are captured as well, although these may not remain. The city’s culture and military buildings (defense perimeter, alien preserve, and so forth) are always destroyed when the city is taken. All other buildings have a 66% chance of being captured intact and remaining in play under your control.</div>
