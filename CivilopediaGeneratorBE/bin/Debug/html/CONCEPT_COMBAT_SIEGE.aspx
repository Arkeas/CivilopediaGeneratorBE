		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Certain Ranged Units are classified as "Siege Units". These units get combat bonuses when attacking enemy cities. They are extremely vulnerable to melee combat, and should be accompanied by Melee Units to fend off enemy assault.<br /><br />Most Siege Units have to be disassembled to move around the map. When they have reached their destination, they must expend a movement point to "set up." They cannot attack until they have done so.<br /><br />Siege Units are important. It's really difficult to capture a well-defended city without them!</div>
