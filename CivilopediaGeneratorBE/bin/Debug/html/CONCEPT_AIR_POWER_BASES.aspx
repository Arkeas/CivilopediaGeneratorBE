		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">In Civilization: Beyond Earth, Air Units do not move around the map like ground and naval units. They must be “based” on a friendly city. Air Units can also be based upon aircraft carriers as well.<br /><br />Note: hover units are not considered Air Units and don’t need to be “based.” They move around the map like other units, and can move over water.</div>
