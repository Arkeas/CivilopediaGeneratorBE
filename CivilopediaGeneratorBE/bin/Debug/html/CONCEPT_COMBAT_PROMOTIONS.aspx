		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Upgrades are organized in tiers. The player must choose an upgrade in a tier before being able to choose one in the next tier. Upgrades are only unlocked when their Affinity level requirements are met. Once a player selects an upgrade, they are asked to choose one of two unique combat perks. Once chosen, the unit's appearance changes and gets the perk for the remainder of the game. The player can only choose one upgrade per tier.</div>
