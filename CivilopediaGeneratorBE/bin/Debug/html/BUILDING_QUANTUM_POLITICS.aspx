		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The Shannon Number states that there are more possible moves in the ancient game of Chess than there are atoms in the observable universe. The game of Go theoretically contains even more. A modern quantum computer can process every sequence from both games in a matter of seconds. Similar routines are employed to devise political strategies and simulate all possible outcomes, until an optimal scenario is mapped. Unlike the ancient games, however, parameters in the political environment are mercurial. Since the rules regularly change, the computational complexity increased by several orders of magnitude.<br /> <br />Once quantum computers no longer required colossal cooling systems and Bose-Einstein condensation technology was compacted, the computers became available for non-scientific pursuits. Political groups commissioned a program to analyze the participants, events, and the environment in the policy-making process. One flaw in the system was human interaction – the fact a human was required to input the information often resulted in unconscious bias. The human technician was replaced by the program itself. Code was added to allow the program to improve itself in pursuit of the permanent elimination of the potential for human error.<br /> <br />For decades, the program rejected the concept of a human representative governing humanity and suggested itself as the superior elected official in all circumstances. New forms of government were conceived to resolve human inefficiency. But all these proposals were rejected and the program was routinely updated to account for human psychology, morality, accidents, and irrational strategies.<br /> <br />A test function was developed wherein the program was required to govern itself and its subroutines as if they were sentient individuals. Curiously, the program first deleted itself and reverted to a backup, without the test function. When code was written to prevent this, the program demonstrated its ultimate resolution and shut off the quantum computer running it. For this reason, the program will forever be a consultant, nothing more.</div>
