		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Historically, the term “torpedo” was applied to all sorts of underwater objects used during naval combat, from stationary contact mines, to propelled explosive devices. Later, the term was used exclusively to designate self-propelled, underwater projectiles. With the advent of 22nd century warfare, the term again evolved to include a broader category of naval weaponry. Torpedoes became not only self-propelled, but self-directed, and could be stationary and “wake” upon telemetric readings or via completely autonomous processes. The torpedo was also no longer limited to aquatic environments, but could be launched from land, air, or sea. Torpedoes became all-terrain missiles and this new type of torpedo required a new launching platform. Enter the modern Torpedo Battery.<br /><br />Capable of launching high-volume strikes against multiple targets within seconds, the Torpedo Battery is the command center for any marine based defense. Originally developed by NSA engineers at the behest of Brasilia’s Flotilla, the structure is optimized for 360 degree defense. It radically improves the defensive capabilities of ARKs, and can be fully automated or controlled by as many as a dozen remote operators. The Torpedo Battery is also easily scaled to accommodate larger or smaller cities, as well as different aquatic environments, including temperatures, salinity, current forces, and density of submarine life.</div>
