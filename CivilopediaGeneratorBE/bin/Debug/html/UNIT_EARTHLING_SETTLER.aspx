		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">When the few thousands set out during the Seeding to insure the survival of the human race, millions were left behind on Old Earth. With few resources and little hope, they struggled to exist on a plundered and crowded planet that had been our home world for untold millennia. Without hope, that is, until suddenly contact came with the opening of a “warp gate” and an invitation to instantly travel across space to join the colony in subduing and settling a new home. No skills, training or wealth were required to come … just a belief in the precepts of Purity and a willingness to work. Tens of desperate thousands accepted and came through the gate to labor on the farms and in the mines, to man the defenses, to build new outposts, to cast their lot with the original colonists in forging a bright future for humanity again on this alien world. It seemed to these masses of refugees from battered Old Earth to truly be a Promised Land.</div>
