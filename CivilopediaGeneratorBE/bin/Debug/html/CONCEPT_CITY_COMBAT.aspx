		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Cities may be attacked and captured by enemy units. Each city has a “Combat Strength” which is determined by the city’s location, its size, whether any military units are “garrisoned” in that city, and whether defensive buildings such as a Defense Perimeter have been constructed in the city. The higher the city’s defensive value, the harder it is to capture the city.<br /><br />Cities are important targets, and if fortified and defended by other units, can be quite difficult to capture. However, doing so can reap rich rewards – in fact, the only way to knock another colony out of the game is to capture or destroy all of its cities. Do this to enough opponents and you can win the game.</div>
