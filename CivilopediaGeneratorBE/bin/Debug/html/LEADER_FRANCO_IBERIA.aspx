<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Long wealthy, &Eacute;lodie’s lineage traces back to the nobility and privileged elite of France and Italy a millennia before the Great Mistake. Her family’s prestige and influence was not, however, based on its peerage, but rather on the immense fortune it had amassed over the previous two centuries from its holdings in agriculture, food processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles. Opportunities since the Great Mistake have made it even richer; for instance, from its pharmaceutical operations during the “super-bug” pandemic after the Great Mistake and its farms, orchards and vineyards in Portugal, France, Sicily and Greece which remained relatively untouched by the fallout.</div>
<h2>Early Life</h2><div class="infobox">Born in Europe’s foremost fertility and maternity clinic in Braga, &Eacute;lodie was her parents’ only child. Raised in luxury along the Cote d’Azur and the Costa del Sol, &Eacute;lodie became a media darling as a teen, although not always portrayed in a flattering light. Reaching maturity, she parlayed that exposure and her experience with the press into a platform for her politics and cultural cachet. Although raised in the Catholic traditions of the New Papacy, &Eacute;lodie professed to follow no specific religion. She was, however, a staunch monotheist and brought her faith into all her dealings.</div>
<h2>Tradition</h2><div class="infobox">Accused by her detractors as an isolationist, and a European elitist, &Eacute;lodie certainly possessed a famously acerbic tongue and quick wit. A strong believer in the value of the Western cultural tradition, she believed that it was up to the educated European elite to guide the masses for their betterment, ensuring the survival of high culture. The best way to do this on Earth was the independence and sustainability of the new Union. More vital, in &Eacute;lodie’s view, was to insure that the Franco-Iberian Union plant colonies off-world.</div>
<h2>The Seeding</h2><div class="infobox">When Franco-Iberia announced its plans to launch a “Seeding,” &Eacute;lodie used her considerable influence and family connections to get her name on the short list for command. Using her media savvy, she managed to get the mass media’s backing, making her a popular choice among the citizenry of the Union despite her age. Beyond the operational matters (and &Eacute;lodie had a knack for choosing able lieutenants), she also personally oversaw the construction of the Canon, the definitive collection of Western art, letters, and music, which became the template for inclusion in the cultural banks of other Seeding projects. Hence, when the colony ship set out, it not only carried people and technology from Franco-Iberia, but some of old Europe’s great artworks and schematics for duplicating many of Europe’s great architectural wonders. &Eacute;lodie’s new colony was not only to prosper, but look good doing so.</div>
