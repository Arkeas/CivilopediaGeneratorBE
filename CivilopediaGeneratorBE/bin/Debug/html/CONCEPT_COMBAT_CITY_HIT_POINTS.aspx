		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">A fully-healthy city has 100 hit points. As it takes damage, the city’s hit points are reduced. When a city’s hit points reach “0,” an enemy unit may enter the city, regardless of any units already inside. When this occurs, the city is captured. The attacker usually has the option of destroying the city or adding the city to his empire, either as a puppet or directly through annexation.</div>
