		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Many units have the ability to “fortify.” This means that the unit “digs in” and creates defensive works in its current location. This gives the unit defensive bonuses, making it much tougher to attack. However, fortifications are strictly defensive: if the unit moves or attacks, the fortifications are destroyed.<br />While fortified, a unit will not activate. It will remain inactive until you manually activate it by clicking on the unit.</div>
