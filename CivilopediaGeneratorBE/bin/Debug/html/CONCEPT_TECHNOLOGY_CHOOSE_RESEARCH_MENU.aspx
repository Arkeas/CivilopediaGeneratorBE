		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The tech web in Beyond Earth is non-linear and radiates out from a central point. Rather than having tech prerequisites, any technology can be researched if you have unlocked any technology adjacent to it. Traversal is bi-directional.<br />When you complete acquiring a new technology, a message screen will open announcing that fact. You will now need to pick a new technology to research and the “Choose Research” message appears on the screen. An icon will also appear in the action list above that message.<br />In the upper left of the Main Map screen it displays the technology you’ve just finished learning (it shows “Habitation” the first time it appears).</div>
