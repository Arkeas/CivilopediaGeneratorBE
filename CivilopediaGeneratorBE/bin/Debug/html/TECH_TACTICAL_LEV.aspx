		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">As mag-lev technology advanced, ever larger vehicles could be raised with mag-lev engines. The military applications were readily apparent to colonial administrators, and various armored fighting vehicles were outfitted, an obvious advantage in combat on a still largely undeveloped planet. Initially, existing designs were simply retrofitted with mag-lev engines. In time, designs to take advantage of the levitation were created. Among the most spectacular were the “LEV Tanks,” AFVs able to mount advanced weapons systems and in some cases equipped with absorption and concentration fields in addition to the traditional composite armor. Mag-lev technology revolutionized military tactics and strategy, making warfare unlike that practiced on Old Earth.</div>
