		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">There's one downside to buildings: most of them cost Energy to maintain. The price depends upon the building in question, and can range from 1 to 2 Energy per turn. The Energy is deducted from your treasury each turn. Buildings that incur maintenance can be sold via the City Screen if necessary. See the section on Energy for more details on maintenance.</div>
