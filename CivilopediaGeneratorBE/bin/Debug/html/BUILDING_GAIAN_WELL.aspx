		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">The production of F1 hybrids through breeding has been common on Old Earth for centuries, making agricultural cultivars highly productive, adaptive and hardy. Most of these hybrids were polyploid, containing more than two or more homologous sets of chromosomes, and produced high-quality triglyceride vegetable oils. Colonial agronomists soon discovered that these crops not only thrived on this planet, but being polyploid were easier to crossbreed with indigenous species, creating self-propagating adaptive species through controlled evolution. Expansive horticultural stations, in a wide variety of terrain types, were established by many colonial settlements where these crops were raised on an industrial scale, as well as experimentation in new F1 hybrids could be conducted. The largest of these stations came to be termed “Gaian Wells,” for their production of hydrogenated oils seemed boundless. Although the planting, tending, harvesting and extraction is automated or robotic, the cutting-edge research at Gaian Wells is largely conducted by human scientists. Their efforts resulted in ever-bearing and rapidly maturing hybrid crops that produce a wide variety of oils used in the production of biodiesel and biobutanol, employed as decorticators and lubricants in industry, and formed the basis for colonial oleochemistry. Gaian Well farming is intensive and industrial, and entails crop rotation, irrigating, terracing, and extensive use of pesticides and herbicides where required to maximize production. The rapid growth of many settlements can be traced to the establishment of a nearby Gaian Well, and the wellspring of energy resources it could provide.</div>
