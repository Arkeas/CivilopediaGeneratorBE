		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Advances in mechatronics, bio-robotics and telerobotics led to interdisciplinary research teams being assembled to determine the practicality and utility of “surrogacy,” the operation of simulated humanoids remotely via the “transfer” of the human consciousness. Through a combination of hypercomputing and nootropics, coupled with quantum communication implants, a person could, while their physical body remained unconscious, project their consciousness to experience and control a “surrogate” body at a distance (limited only by the quantum state). While applications in exploration, combat and construction are apparent and the technology is readily accessible, it has been a matter of intense debate as to whether surrogacy offers any significant benefits over autonomous robots, artificial intelligence or telerobots. Nonetheless, several settlements have proceeded to create centers for surrogate control, although use of these are as yet limited to accredited human operators monitored by medical personnel.</div>
