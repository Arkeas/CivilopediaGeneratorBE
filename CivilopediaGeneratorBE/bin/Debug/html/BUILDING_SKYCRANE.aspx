		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Mag-lev engines have numerous applications, not the least in the realm of construction. For millennia, humans have used cranes to lift and move heavy weights; it was to be expected that once large mag-lev engines were designed, among the first things to which it was applied would be cranes capable of operating above the surface on both surface and low orbital projects. Because of the nature of magnetic levitation, the sum of all the moments about the base was near zero, skycranes were very stable, and hence the lift load exceeded the usual 85% of the tip load of ground-stable cranes. Colonial skycranes tended to be of two types: overhead (or bridge), where the hook-and-line mechanism was located under the platform, and sidelift pick-and-carry cranes, where the arm extended over the side of the platform. The largest skycranes had both systems, and some incorporated Bessel beam systems as well. One of the primary challenges with ground-based cranes is leveling, which was avoided in skycrane designs by installing multiple mag-lev engines. In low-orbit construction, skycranes are the standard equipment for shifting and maneuvering large components into position, using hydraulic arms in hammerhead configurations. While load weight is not an issue for skycranes in low-orbit, load inertia is … hence many of the skycranes built specifically for orbital construction have inertial dampers of various types installed.</div>
