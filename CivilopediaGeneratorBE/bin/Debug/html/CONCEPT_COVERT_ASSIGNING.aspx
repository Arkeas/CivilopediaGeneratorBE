		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">When an agent is unassigned to a city, he is said to be “at Headquarters.” Agents at headquarters are inactive. You can assign an agent who is at headquarters to any city which currently doesn’t have one of your agents assigned to it (one agent per player per city).<br /><br />Once assigned, it takes a few turns for the agent to arrive and become active. Once an agent has arrived in a city, the plots around the city become visible to the player (if not already visible) and the agent can begin performing operations.</div>
