		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Cities have a Combat Strength, just like units. The city’s Strength represents its Combat Strength and Ranged Combat Strength. During combat the city’s hit points may decline due to enemy attacks, but its Combat and Ranged Combat strengths remain equal to its initial strength — no matter how much damage the city has taken.</div>
