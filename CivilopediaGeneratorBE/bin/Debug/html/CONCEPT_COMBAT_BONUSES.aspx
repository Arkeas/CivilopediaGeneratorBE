		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Units receive a variety of benefits during combat, some from the unit’s location, others from its defensive posture, and others from a variety of special circumstances. Some bonuses apply only to an attacking unit, some only to a defending unit, and some might apply to both. The most common bonuses come from the terrain the unit occupies, and whether the defending unit is “fortified.”</div>
