		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">The Air Unit attacks a ground target (unit or City) within its air range.<br /><br />When a unit is ordered to make an Air Strike against an enemy City or unit, if it is not Intercepted, it performs a ranged attack against the target. Unlike most ranged attacks, however, the attacking unit can take damage from the attack. If the Air Striking unit survives, it returns to its base.</div>
