		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">You acquire Virtues based upon the total amount of culture produced by all of your cities cumulative. Check the Status Bar at the top of the Main Screen to see how much total culture your colony has accumulated, how much culture the colony is producing each turn, and how much is required before you can select a new Virtue.<br /><br />When you have accumulated enough culture, you must go to the Virtues Screen and buy a new virtue. Each time you purchase a new virtue the price of the next one increases. When you have enough culture amassed to purchase a new Virtue, you will be prompted to do so.</div>
