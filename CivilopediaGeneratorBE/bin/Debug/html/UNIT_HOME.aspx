			With mankind’s expansion into the solar system and beyond, new forms of combat and peace-keeping were required, and military technology evolved to meet these. Initially, the colonial administrations utilized existing organization and weaponry found useful in the exploitation and settlement of Earth’s solar neighbors. But the longer the colonies survived on the new planet, and the more extensive the colonial operations became, the more the settlers depended on the military units for protection from native lifeforms, and occasionally from other colonies. Over the course of time, many new types of units that took advantage of unique planetary resources and conditions, or new scientific theories and discoveries, were devised. Within a few generations, warfare on the new planet was considerably different from that on and around Old Earth.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the civilian units were the backbone of colonial success or failure. The explorers, workers, craftsmen, homesteaders and traders tamed new lands on the frontiers and built new settlements on the fringes of “civilization.” Moving outward from the cities, these found and harvested new resources, made contact with others from Old Earth, and tried to avoid antagonizing the native lifeforms. When they were unable to do so, they called upon the colonial military units for help.
