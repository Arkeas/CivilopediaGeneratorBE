<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">Avuncular, genial, affable, affecting an air of bonhomie, Samatar Jama Barre wished to be addressed as Kubwa Mjomba (“great uncle” in Swahili) by those he both commanded and protected. Despite his seeming benevolence and absent-minded demeanor, he was nonetheless an efficient and effective administrator, an able diplomat, and ruthless when necessary. Barre was amused and likely pleased when detractors likened him to the traditional African village chieftains of the past, claiming him to be a throwback and out-of-step with the new world in the wake of the Great Mistake. But the Peoples’ African Union made a wise choice when he was selected as one of their colony governors.</div>
<h2>Early Life</h2><div class="infobox">Rising from the poverty and violence of the inundated streets of Hargeisa, Samatar joined the African Union’s resurgent military forces, eventually rising to the rank of Major. For three decades he served in a variety of increasingly important posts, military and civilian, rising steadily in both ability and influence. He was able to overcome lingering tribal tensions, dealing with the polyglot cultures of Africa with both reverence and common sense. Barre displayed those same diplomatic skills when negotiating with those outside the African Union, and brought to culmination several international agreements that helped propel the Union’s colonization effort before he was selected to command one of those colonies.</div>
<h2>The Great Uncle</h2><div class="infobox">Barre proved to be just as efficient against any perceived threat to the well-being and safety of those under his protection. In dealing with nascent warlords, religious fanatics, and local dictators, he either brought about an equitable peace, or bludgeoned them into submission. Although never known as a military genius, his troops were extremely loyal to their “great uncle” and fought with abandon for his approval. Samatar Barre never lost a battle, although he took no credit for his victories and viewed them as lamentable necessities.</div>
<h2>Verdict of History</h2><div class="infobox">Though not religious himself, he was tolerant and accepting of others' religious traditions. In the end, it was this tolerance, coupled with his intellect and personality that would shape the African Union’s colony on the new planet.</div>
