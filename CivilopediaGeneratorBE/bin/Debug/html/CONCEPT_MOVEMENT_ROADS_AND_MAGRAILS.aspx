		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">Roads (and later in the game, Magrail) cut a unit’s movement cost in friendly or neutral territory. As long as the unit moves from one tile containing a road into another tile containing a road, the unit will expend just a fraction of the normal cost to move. So long as the unit has any MPs left, it can continue to move along the road.</div>
