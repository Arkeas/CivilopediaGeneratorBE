		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="infobox">An Outpost is, in a word, a proto-city: a small installation that is placed on the map and acquires territory like a city, but which does not yet have the advantages of a city. Outposts cannot produce Buildings, military Units, or Wonders, and cannot bombard enemy units. Outposts get exclusive rights to improve tiles within their territory, and to the yields those tiles produce, but Outpost territory does not restrict the movement of enemy military units.<br /><br />Outposts have no ranged strike capabilities and a weak Combat Strength, and are destroyed rather than captured when they are overrun. Units may be garrisoned in them, and will conduct melee or ranged combat as usual.<br /><br />The sole exception to the Outpost-phase of city creation is the player’s capital – the first city you build at the beginning of the game. The capital city is founded already complete; all subsequent “founding” actions produce Outposts.</div>
