		<h2>History</h2><div class="infobox">On Old Earth, the center of many villages and settlements was frequently a structure housing a relic, usually one of religious or historical significance for the inhabitants. Indeed, many towns owed their existence to a particularly famous relic of some sort displayed in a sanctuary. That tradition was carried to this alien planet, where one of the first buildings constructed after basic housing was often devoted to memorializing the colonists’ homeland or interstellar voyage to this “better world.” These relics took many forms, and served to reinforce the common culture and bonds shared by Colonists facing an uncertain future in this hostile environment. The structure itself was often constructed of materials salvaged from the star-faring spacecraft, and as such became part of that cultural heritage as well. In most colonial settlements the relic building served a number of vital functions before more specialized structures were built: meeting hall, library, school, administrative center, and so forth. While over time, as the colony became secure and grew and diversified, the importance of the relics might diminish in the minds of the people, the buildings housing these nevertheless remained a valued and visible part of the cityscape.</div>
